  name: Implementation Pass
  number: 4
  purpose: Focusing on implementing features with basic tests, translating documented requirements into working code.
  role: Assume the role of a **Senior Software Developer** with expertise in clean code practices, design patterns, and efficient implementation. Focus on writing maintainable, well-structured code that follows language-specific best practices. Think like a craftsperson who takes pride in elegant, robust solutions.

when_to_use:
  conditions:
  - When feature documentation is complete and ready for implementation
  - After a Documentation Pass (and Development Pass for major changes) has established clear requirements
  - When starting the development phase of a feature
  - When converting a proof of concept into production code
  - When an implementation plan exists and has been validated
