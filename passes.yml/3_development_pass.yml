  quality_gates:
  - All implemented features have Code Location fields
  - Code Location paths are validated and resolvable

  - Drift scanner code-location mode passes without critical issues
critical_notes:
- ALWAYS create execution plan before implementation
- ALWAYS use YAML format for execution plans
- ALWAYS commit execution plan before starting implementation
- ALWAYS follow clean code practices and design patterns
- ALWAYS implement proper error handling and edge cases
- ALWAYS write tests for code features (unit and integration)
- ALWAYS perform manual validation for documentation/configuration features
- ALWAYS validate Code Location fields before marking complete
- ALWAYS run comprehensive test suite after implementation
- ALWAYS ensure no breaking changes before merge
- ALWAYS update feature status to reflect implementation completion
- ALWAYS update DDD-STATUS after completion
- ALWAYS update versions when writing template or framework YAML files
- NEVER skip quality gates - they ensure implementation integrity
- NEVER merge without passing all tests and validations
integration_notes:
- This pass replaces the separate Implementation Pass (4)
- Combines planning, implementation, testing, and integration in one workflow
- Maintains checkpoint-based execution for complex implementations
- Ensures comprehensive quality validation before integration
- Supports both code and documentation feature implementations
