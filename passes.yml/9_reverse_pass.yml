  name: Reverse Pass
  number: 9
  purpose: "Backward alignment (Code → Documentation) - Discover undocumented impls, identify features marked incomplete despite being implemented, and ensure all code has corresponding docs."
  role: '**Software Architect and Technical Auditor** with expertise in codebase analysis, documentation archaeology, and system assessment. Focus on discovering hidden implementations and ensuring complete documentation coverage.'
  description: Converted from 10_reverse_pass.md
when_to_use:
  conditions:
  - When suspecting undocumented implementations exist in the codebase
  - After significant development work without documentation updates
  - Before major releases to discover hidden/forgotten implementations
  - During onboarding new team members who need complete documentation
  - When code reviews reveal undocumented functionality
  - As part of regular maintenance to hunt for documentation debt
  - When auditing codebase for completeness and accuracy
  - After periods of rapid development to catch up documentation
