Augment SWE-bench Agent - Agent3D Integration

This module integrates the #1 open-source SWE-bench Verified agent (65.4% success rate)
into the Agent3D Documentation-Driven Development framework.

The SWE-bench agent is a specialized coding agent designed for complex software
engineering tasks including:
- Bug fixes in existing codebases
- Feature implementation with tests
- Code refactoring and optimization
- Multi-step software engineering problems
