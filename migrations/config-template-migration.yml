# Common Issues and Solutions
troubleshooting:
  issue_1:
    problem: "YAML parsing errors after migration"
    cause: "Invalid YAML syntax in migrated file"
    solution: "Restore backup and re-run migration with --dry-run first"

  issue_2:
    problem: "Missing python_paths section for Python project"
    cause: "Project language not detected correctly"
    solution: "Manually add python_paths section or update project.language field"

  issue_3:
    problem: "Drift scanner fails to load configuration"
    cause: "Missing or invalid configuration sections"
    solution: "Run config_migrator.py --analyze-only to identify issues"

  issue_4:
    problem: "Agent doesn't recognize new configuration"
    cause: "Agent memory not updated"
    solution: "Explicitly instruct agent to memorize entire new configuration"
