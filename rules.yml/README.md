# Language Rules - YAML Format

This directory contains language-specific development rules converted to YAML format for optimal LLM agent processing and automated code review.

## Available Language Rules

- `python.yml` - Python development standards and best practices
- `javascript.yml` - JavaScript/TypeScript development rules
- `java.yml` - Java development standards
- `go.yml` - Go development best practices
- `markdown.yml` - Markdown documentation rules and LLM optimization

## YAML Structure

Each language rule file contains:

```yaml

  language: "language_name"
  version: "supported_versions"
  description: "Language-specific rules for DDD framework"
  last_updated: "2025-01-27"

  setup: "development environment configuration"
  dependencies: "dependency management rules"
  configuration: "project configuration standards"

code_style:

## Benefits of YAML Format

### For LLM Agents
- **Structured Rules**: Hierarchical organization for easy rule lookup
- **Automated Review**: Direct integration with code review automation
- **Decision Support**: Clear severity levels and quality gates
- **Context Awareness**: Language-specific vs universal rules
- **Validation**: Automated quality gate checking

### For Development Tools
- **IDE Integration**: Language server integration possibilities
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated quality checking in pipelines
- **Linting Configuration**: Generate linter configs from rules
- **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate coding standards docs

## Usage Examples

### Loading Language Rules
```python
import yaml

# Load Python rules
with open('rules.yml/python.yml') as f:
    python_rules = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Access testing requirements
testing_rules = python_rules['testing']['implementation_requirements']
for rule in testing_rules['critical_rules']:
    print(f"Critical: {rule['name']} - {rule['description']}")
```

### Code Review Automation
```python
def get_review_criteria(language):
    with open(f'rules.yml/{language}.yml') as f:
        rules = yaml.safe_load(f)
    
    return {
        'role': rules['code_review']['role'],
        'critical_areas': rules['code_review']['critical_areas'],
        'severity_levels': rules['code_review']['severity_levels']
    }

def classify_issue_severity(issue, language_rules):
    severity_levels = language_rules['code_review']['severity_levels']
    
    for level, issues in severity_levels.items():
        if issue in issues['issues']:
            return level
    
    return 'low'
```

### Quality Gate Validation
```python
def validate_quality_gates(code_analysis, language):
    with open(f'rules.yml/{language}.yml') as f:
        rules = yaml.safe_load(f)
    
    quality_gates = rules['quality_gates']
    results = {}
    
    for gate_name, gate_config in quality_gates.items():
        if isinstance(gate_config, list):
            for gate in gate_config:
                check_name = gate['name']
                validation = gate['check']
                results[check_name] = validate_check(code_analysis, validation)
    
    return results
```

### Language-Specific Configuration
```python
def generate_project_config(language, project_type):
    with open(f'rules.yml/{language}.yml') as f:
        rules = yaml.safe_load(f)
    
    config = {
        'environment': rules['environment'],
        'code_style': rules['code_style'],
        'testing': rules['testing']['framework']
    }
    
    # Customize based on project type
    if project_type == 'library':
        config['documentation'] = rules['documentation']
    
    return config
```

## Language-Specific Features

## Integration with DDD Framework

### Pass Integration
Language rules integrate with DDD passes for:
- **Code Review Pass**: Automated review criteria
- **Testing Pass**: Language-specific testing requirements
- **Refactoring Pass**: Language-specific optimization patterns

### Quality Validation
Rules provide quality gates for:
- **Synchronization Pass**: Code-documentation alignment
- **Development Pass**: Implementation standards
- **Foundation Pass**: Project setup standards

### Tool Integration
- **Drift Scanner**: Language-aware drift detection
- **MCP Servers**: Real-time rule validation
- **VSCode Extension**: IDE integration for rule enforcement

## Migration from Markdown

Original Markdown rules in `../rules/` remain for human reference. YAML versions provide:

- **Machine Processing**: Better automation and tool integration
- **Structured Validation**: Programmatic quality gate checking
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Additional fields for tool integration
- **Conditional Logic**: Context-aware rule application

## Best Practices

### For LLM Agents
1. **Cache Rules**: Load language rules once per session
2. **Context Awareness**: Apply rules based on file types and project context
3. **Severity Handling**: Prioritize critical issues over style issues
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with critical rules, add others gradually
5. **Feedback Integration**: Learn from code review outcomes

### For Development Teams
1. **Consistency**: Ensure rules align with team practices
2. **Tool Integration**: Configure linters and IDEs based on rules
3. **Training**: Use rules for onboarding and code review training
4. **Evolution**: Update rules based on team experience and industry changes
5. **Documentation**: Keep rules synchronized with team documentation

## Schema Validation

JSON schemas for rule validation are available at `../schemas/rules.schema.json` (when created).

## Contributing

When modifying language rules:
1. Update both YAML and Markdown versions
2. Validate YAML syntax and structure
3. Test with real projects in the target language
4. Ensure quality gates are testable and measurable
5. Update integration documentation

## Custom Rules

Teams can extend rules by:
1. Adding custom sections to existing language files
2. Creating new language rule files
3. Overriding specific rules in project `.agent3d-config.yml`
4. Contributing improvements back to the framework

*These YAML language rules enable sophisticated automated code review and quality validation while maintaining the comprehensive guidance of the original DDD framework.*
