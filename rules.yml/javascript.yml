    content: '**Formatting:**


      - Use ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting

      - Use 2 spaces for indentation

      - Limit lines to 80-100 characters

      - Use semicolons consistently (either always or never)

      - Use single quotes for strings unless escaping is needed

      - Co-locate tests with the code they test when possible

      - Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior

  error_handling:
    description: Error Handling
    content: '**Async Code:**


      - Always handle promise rejections

      - Use try/catch blocks with async/await

      - Log errors with appropriate context


      **Error Types:**


      - Create custom error classes for application-specific errors

      - Include stack traces in development

      - Sanitize error messages in production

      - Return appropriate HTTP status codes in API responses'
  performance:
    description: Performance
    content: '**Optimization:**


      - Optimize only after measuring performance

      - Use performance profiling tools (Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse)

      - Minimize DOM manipulations

      - Use debouncing and throttling for frequent events


      **Loading:**


      - Use code splitting to reduce initial bundle size

      - Lazy load components and routes when appropriate

      - Optimize and compress images and assets

      - Use appropriate caching strategies'
  security:
    description: Security
    content: '**Input Validation:**


      - Validate all user inputs

      - Sanitize data before rendering to prevent XSS

      - Use parameterized queries for database operations

      - Avoid eval(), Function(), and similar functions


      **Authentication and Authorization:**


      - Use established libraries for authentication

      - Store tokens securely (HttpOnly cookies)

      - Implement proper CSRF protection

      - Use HTTPS for all production traffic'
  frontend_specific_(react/vue/angular):
    description: Frontend Specific (React/Vue/Angular)
    content: '**Component Design:**


      - Keep components small and focused

      - Separate container and presentational components

      - Use composition over inheritance

      - Implement proper prop validation


      **State Management:**


      - Choose appropriate state management based on project complexity

      - Keep state normalized to avoid inconsistencies

      - Document state shape and mutations

      - Minimize state changes for better performance'

      ### Critical Review Areas


      #### 1. Type Safety and TypeScript Usage


      **CRITICAL:** Enforce TypeScript usage for type safety and maintainability.


      - Use TypeScript for type safety and better IDE support

      - Define interfaces for complex data structures

      - Avoid any type; use specific types or generics

      - Enforce strict TypeScript configuration


      #### 2. Async/Await and Promise Handling


      **CRITICAL:** Demand proper error handling in async operations.


      - Add proper error handling for all async operations

      - Check response status before processing

      - Use custom error types for better error handling

      - Never ignore promise rejections


      #### 3. Modern JavaScript Patterns


      **CRITICAL:** Enforce ES6+ patterns and avoid legacy JavaScript.


      - Use const/let instead of var

      - Use array methods (filter, map, reduce) instead of loops

      - Use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==)

      - Leverage destructuring and spread operator


      #### 4. Component Architecture (React/Vue)


      **CRITICAL:** Enforce proper component patterns and lifecycle management.


      - Use functional components with hooks instead of class components

      - Implement proper loading and error states

      - Use TypeScript interfaces for props

      - Handle cleanup in useEffect when necessary


      #### 5. Performance Optimization


      **CRITICAL:** Review for performance anti-patterns and memory leaks.


      - Use useMemo for expensive calculations

      - Use useCallback for event handlers passed to children

      - Avoid creating new objects/functions in render

      - Implement proper key props for list items


      #### 6. Module System and Imports


      **CRITICAL:** Enforce proper ES6 module patterns.


      - Use ES6 import/export syntax consistently

      - Use barrel exports for cleaner import statements

      - Import types separately when using TypeScript

      - Organize imports logically


      #### 7. Error Handling and Logging


      **CRITICAL:** Implement comprehensive error handling strategies.


      - Use structured logging instead of console.log

      - Implement proper error classification

      - Include context in error messages

      - Use error boundaries in React applications


      ### Severity Classification


      **Critical:** Missing error handling in async operations, memory leaks, security
      vulnerabilities (XSS, injection), missing TypeScript types on public APIs, unhandled
      promise rejections

      **High:** Using legacy JavaScript patterns, missing component optimization,
      poor error messages, inconsistent module patterns, missing input validation

      **Medium:** Missing JSDoc comments, inconsistent naming conventions, suboptimal
      bundle size, missing accessibility attributes

      **Low:** Code style improvements, additional TypeScript strictness, performance
      micro-optimizations, documentation enhancements


      ### Anti-Patterns to Reject


      - Using var instead of const/let, mutating props or state directly

      - Missing dependency arrays in useEffect, using any type in TypeScript

      - Not handling async errors, creating functions inside render

      - Using == instead of ===, not cleaning up event listeners/subscriptions


      ### Quality Gates


      - [ ] TypeScript used with proper type definitions

      - [ ] All async operations have error handling

      - [ ] Modern JavaScript patterns used throughout

      - [ ] Components optimized for performance
