    content: '**JDK Version:**


      - Use LTS (Long Term Support) versions of Java when possible

      - Document required Java version in build files

      - Use consistent JDK version across development, CI/CD, and production


      **Build Tools:**


      - Use Gradle or Maven for build automation

      - Include wrapper scripts (gradlew/mvnw) in the repository

      - Define all dependencies in build file, not in IDE

      - Use dependency locking to ensure reproducible builds'
  code_style:
    description: Code Style
    content: '**Formatting:**


      - Follow Google Java Style Guide or similar established style

      - Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs

      - Limit line length to 100-120 characters

      - Use tools like Checkstyle, PMD, or SpotBugs for static analysis


      **Naming Conventions:**


      - `camelCase` for variables, methods, parameters

      - `PascalCase` for classes and interfaces

      - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

      - Use descriptive names that reflect purpose

      - Prefix interfaces with ''I'' only when both interface and implementation exist


      **Organization:**


      - One top-level class per file

      - Group related classes in packages

      - Follow standard package naming conventions (com.company.project.module)

      - Order class members logically (constants, fields, constructors, methods)'
  best_practices:
    description: Best Practices
    content: '**Object-Oriented Design:**


      - Follow SOLID principles

      - Prefer composition over inheritance

      - Design for extension but restrict subclassing when appropriate

      - Make fields private and provide getters/setters only when necessary


      **Immutability:**


      - Make classes immutable when possible

      - Use final for fields that shouldn''t change after initialization

      - Use defensive copying for mutable parameters and return values

      - Use immutable collections when appropriate


      **Exception Handling:**


      - Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions

      - Use unchecked exceptions for programming errors

      - Include meaningful error messages

      - Clean up resources in finally blocks or use try-with-resources


      **Concurrency:**


      - Prefer higher-level concurrency utilities over raw threads

      - Use thread pools for managing worker threads

      - Make classes thread-safe or clearly document thread safety guarantees

      - Be cautious with synchronization to avoid deadlocks'
  documentation:
    description: Documentation
    content: "1. **Javadoc**\n   - Write Javadoc for all public classes and methods\n\
      \   - Include @param, @return, and @throws tags\n   - Document thread safety\
      \ guarantees\n   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes\n\n2. **Comments**\n\
      \   - Use comments to explain complex algorithms or non-obvious solutions\n\
      \   - Avoid redundant comments that just repeat the code\n   - Use TODO comments\
      \ for temporary solutions or incomplete implementations\n   - Document performance\
      \ characteristics for critical operations"
  testing:
    description: Testing
    content: "1. **Test Framework**\n   - Use JUnit 5 for unit testing\n   - Use Mockito\
      \ for mocking dependencies\n   - Use AssertJ or similar for fluent assertions\n\
      \   - Write both unit and integration tests\n\n2. **Test Organization**\n  \
      \ - Mirror the package structure of the main code\n   - Name test classes with\
      \ \"Test\" suffix\n   - Write focused tests that verify a single behavior\n\
      \   - Use appropriate test fixtures and setup methods\n   - **TC ID Mapping:**\
      \ **CRITICAL** - Each test method MUST include TC-NNNN in name or @DisplayName\
      \ for 1:1 traceability"
  performance:
    description: Performance
    content: "1. **Optimization**\n   - Optimize only after measuring performance\n\
      \   - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks\n   - Consider memory usage\
      \ and garbage collection\n   - Document performance characteristics and requirements\n\
      \n2. **Collections**\n   - Choose appropriate collection types for the use case\n\
      \   - Specify initial capacity for collections when the size is known\n   -\
      \ Use streams for processing collections when appropriate\n   - Be cautious\
      \ with large collections and memory usage"
  security:
    description: Security
    content: "1. **Input Validation**\n   - Validate all user inputs\n   - Use parameterized\
      \ queries for database operations\n   - Sanitize data before displaying it to\
      \ users\n   - Be cautious with reflection, deserialization, and dynamic code\
      \ execution\n\n2. **Sensitive Data**\n   - Don't log sensitive information\n\
      \   - Don't include sensitive data in exception messages\n   - Properly handle\
      \ secrets and credentials\n   - Use secure random number generation for security-sensitive\
      \ operations"
  deployment:
    description: Deployment
    content: "1. **Containerization**\n   - Use Docker for containerizing Java applications\n\
      \   - Create minimal container images\n   - Use multi-stage builds to reduce\
      \ image size\n   - Don't run containers as root\n\n2. **Configuration**\n  \
      \ - Use environment variables or external configuration sources\n   - Never\
      \ hardcode sensitive information\n   - Provide sensible defaults for all configuration\
      \ options\n   - Document all configuration parameters"

      ### Critical Review Areas


      #### 1. Object-Oriented Design and SOLID Principles


      **CRITICAL:** Enforce proper OOP design and SOLID principles.


      - Split class responsibilities according to Single Responsibility Principle

      - Use dependency injection instead of direct instantiation

      - Apply Interface Segregation Principle for better testability

      - Enforce proper encapsulation and abstraction


      #### 2. Exception Handling and Resource Management


      **CRITICAL:** Demand proper exception hierarchy and resource cleanup.


      - Use try-with-resources for automatic resource management

      - Create specific exception types instead of catching Exception

      - Never return null on error; throw meaningful exceptions

      - Use proper logging instead of silent failures


      #### 3. Concurrency and Thread Safety


      **CRITICAL:** Scrutinize thread safety and concurrent data structure usage.


      - Use AtomicInteger/AtomicReference for simple thread-safe operations

      - Implement proper synchronization for compound operations

      - Use concurrent collections from java.util.concurrent

      - Avoid synchronized methods; prefer synchronized blocks


      #### 4. Memory Management and Performance

      patterns, inadequate test coverage, missing input validation

      **Medium:** Missing JavaDoc on public APIs, inconsistent naming conventions,
      suboptimal collection usage, missing logging

      **Low:** Code style improvements, additional modern Java features, performance
      micro-optimizations, documentation enhancements


      ### Anti-Patterns to Reject


      - Using raw types instead of generics, catching Exception instead of specific
      exceptions

      - Not using try-with-resources, synchronizing on public objects

      - Using == for object comparison, not overriding equals() and hashCode() together

      - Using Vector or Hashtable, creating unnecessary objects in loops
