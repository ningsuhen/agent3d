- During automated build processes

## Process
1. **Scan:** 
   - Systematically review all documentation against code
   - Automatically detect inconsistencies between code and documentation
2. **Draft:** 
   - Document all discrepancies and required updates
   - Generate reports of detected discrepancies
3. **Ask:** 
   - Clarify any uncertainties about implementation or requirements
   - (May be automated for routine checks)
4. **Sync:** 
   - Update all documentation to ensure complete accuracy
   - Flag issues for resolution before proceeding

## Expected Outcomes
- Verified consistency across all documentation
- Identified and resolved documentation gaps
- Updated status of all features and tasks
- Comprehensive alignment of documentation with code
- Early detection of documentation drift
- Prevented merging of code without documentation updates
