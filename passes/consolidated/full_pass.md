# Full Pass

**Purpose:** A comprehensive pass that encompasses all aspects of documentation-driven development, from foundation to refinement, ensuring complete alignment between documentation and code.

**Encompasses:** All other passes (Foundation, Feature Documentation, Roadmap, Clarity, Alignment, Reconciliation, Validation, Refinement)

## When to Use
- For major project milestones or releases
- When onboarding a new codebase or project
- During significant overhauls of existing systems
- For annual or semi-annual documentation health checks
- When preparing for external audits or reviews

## Process
1. **Scan:** 
   - Comprehensively review the entire codebase and documentation
   - Identify all gaps, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement
   - Map the current state of documentation against code
2. **Draft:** 
   - Create or update foundational documentation (architecture, features)
   - Document all requirements and technical constraints
   - Update roadmap and priorities
   - Clarify ambiguities
   - Align documentation with current implementation
   - Reconcile any major divergences
3. **Ask:** 
   - Engage stakeholders for clarification on all aspects
   - Validate assumptions and decisions
   - Seek feedback on documentation quality and completeness
4. **Sync:** 
   - Ensure complete alignment between documentation and code
   - Refine documentation for clarity and relevance
   - Validate all documentation against implementation
   - Remove outdated content

## Expected Outcomes
- Fully aligned documentation and code
- Complete and accurate architectural documentation
- Comprehensive feature documentation
- Updated roadmap and priorities
- Resolved ambiguities
- Improved documentation quality and readability
- Removed outdated or redundant content
- Validated consistency across all documentation

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Full Pass - Comprehensive documentation update for v3.0 release`

## Execution Strategy
A Full Pass is extensive and may be executed in phases, focusing on different aspects:

1. **Foundation & Feature Phase**
   - Update architectural documentation
   - Document all features and requirements

2. **Clarity & Roadmap Phase**
   - Resolve ambiguities
   - Update project roadmap and priorities

3. **Alignment & Reconciliation Phase**
   - Align documentation with current implementation
   - Reconcile any major divergences

4. **Validation & Refinement Phase**
   - Verify documentation accuracy
   - Improve quality and remove outdated content

Each phase follows the Scan → Draft → Ask → Sync workflow, building upon the previous phase.
