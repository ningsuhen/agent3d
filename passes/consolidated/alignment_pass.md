# Alignment Pass

**Purpose:** Aligning documentation with code for small to medium changes, ensuring consistency between implementation and documentation.

**Combines:** Sync Sprint + Delta Pass

## When to Use
- After quick code changes that weren't documented
- When implementing a small feature or bug fix
- When documentation needs minor updates to match implementation
- For routine alignment of code and documentation
- During iterative development cycles

## Process
1. **Scan:** 
   - Identify minor discrepancies between code and documentation
   - Identify specific changes that need documentation
2. **Draft:** 
   - Make targeted updates to documentation
   - Update only the affected documentation sections
3. **Ask:** 
   - Clarify any uncertainties about implementation details
   - Clarify details about specific changes
4. **Sync:** 
   - Ensure documentation accurately reflects current code
   - Ensure specific changes are accurately documented

## Expected Outcomes
- Documentation that accurately reflects current implementation
- Updated status markers in task lists
- Corrected technical details in specifications
- Aligned feature descriptions with actual functionality
- Clear description of what changed and why
- Updated test cases if applicable

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Alignment Pass - Updated API documentation to match current endpoints and parameters`
