# Feature Documentation Pass

**Purpose:** Documenting features and requirements, whether they are predefined or being discovered through exploration.

**Combines:** Feature Forge + Discovery Dive

## When to Use
- Adding a new feature to the project
- Exploring unfamiliar technical domains
- Converting a high-level feature request into detailed specifications
- Investigating integration requirements with external systems
- Researching technical feasibility of proposed features

## Process
1. **Scan:** 
   - Identify where the feature fits in existing documentation
   - Identify knowledge gaps in current documentation
2. **Draft:** 
   - Create detailed feature specifications including user stories, acceptance criteria
   - Document findings, constraints, and alternatives
   - Document technical requirements and integration points
3. **Ask:** 
   - Clarify feature scope, priorities, and edge cases
   - Seek clarification on technical uncertainties or domain-specific questions
4. **Sync:** 
   - Update `FEATURES.md` and other relevant documentation
   - Document newly discovered information and constraints

## Expected Outcomes
- Detailed feature entry in `FEATURES.md`
- Associated test cases in `TEST-CASES.md`
- Documented technical constraints and limitations
- Identified integration requirements
- Exploration of design alternatives
- Updated risk assessments
- New entries in `TASKS.md` based on discoveries

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Feature Documentation Pass - Documented payment gateway integration requirements and specifications`
