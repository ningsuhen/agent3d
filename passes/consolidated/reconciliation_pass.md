# Reconciliation Pass

**Purpose:** Major realignment of documentation and code after significant divergence, requiring comprehensive reconciliation.

**Equivalent to:** Rendition Resolve

## When to Use
- After major refactoring without documentation updates
- When significant undocumented features have been implemented
- During technical debt reduction efforts
- When preparing for a major release

## Process
1. **Scan:** Comprehensively identify all areas of divergence
2. **Draft:** Create detailed updates to bring documentation in line with code
3. **Ask:** Clarify complex implementation details or design decisions
4. **Sync:** Ensure documentation fully reflects the current implementation

## Expected Outcomes
- Fully reconciled documentation and code
- Updated architectural diagrams reflecting current structure
- Comprehensive feature documentation matching implementation
- Aligned test cases and deployment documentation

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Reconciliation Pass - Reconciled documentation with database schema changes and new API endpoints`
