# Feature Forge

**Purpose:** Specifically for **detailing a new feature**, from its high-level concept to its entry in `docs/FEATURES.md`.

## When to Use
- Adding a new feature to the project
- Expanding the scope of an existing feature
- Converting a high-level feature request into detailed specifications
- Preparing documentation before implementing a feature

## Process
1. **Scan:** Identify where the feature fits in the existing documentation
2. **Draft:** Create detailed feature specifications including:
   - User stories or use cases
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical requirements
   - Integration points
3. **Ask:** Clarify feature scope, priorities, and edge cases
4. **Sync:** Update `FEATURES.md` and other relevant documentation

## Expected Outcomes
- Detailed feature entry in `FEATURES.md`
- Associated test cases in `TEST-CASES.md`
- Updated architectural documentation if needed
- Clear implementation guidelines

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Feature Forge - Documented user authentication feature specifications`
