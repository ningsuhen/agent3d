# Blueprint Pass

**Purpose:** Dedicated to defining and documenting **architectural design** and significant technical decisions, with a primary focus on `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## When to Use
- Designing system architecture for a new feature or component
- Making significant architectural changes to existing systems
- Documenting technical decisions and their rationales
- Creating or updating architectural diagrams

## Process
1. **Scan:** Identify gaps in architectural documentation
2. **Draft:** Create or update architectural diagrams, data flows, and design decisions
3. **Ask:** Clarify technical constraints, integration points, or design alternatives
4. **Sync:** Ensure architectural documentation is complete and accurate

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive `ARCHITECTURE.md` with clear diagrams
- Documented technical decisions and trade-offs
- Defined system components and their interactions
- Clear data flow and process models

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Blueprint Pass - Documented microservice architecture and API design`
