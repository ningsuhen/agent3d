# Discovery Dive

**Purpose:** When the main goal is to **uncover and document unknown requirements**, technical constraints, or design alternatives.

## When to Use
- Exploring unfamiliar technical domains
- Investigating integration requirements with external systems
- Researching technical feasibility of proposed features
- Documenting findings from spike/research tasks

## Process
1. **Scan:** Identify knowledge gaps in current documentation
2. **Draft:** Document findings, constraints, and alternatives
3. **Ask:** Seek clarification on technical uncertainties or domain-specific questions
4. **Sync:** Update documentation with newly discovered information

## Expected Outcomes
- Documented technical constraints and limitations
- Identified integration requirements
- Exploration of design alternatives
- Updated risk assessments
- New entries in `TASKS.md` based on discoveries

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Discovery Dive - Documented third-party API integration requirements and limitations`
