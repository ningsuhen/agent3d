# Delta Pass

**Purpose:** When a **small, incremental change** has occurred in either code or documentation, focusing solely on reconciling that specific difference.

## When to Use
- After implementing a small feature or bug fix
- When a specific documentation section needs updating
- For isolated changes that don't affect the broader system
- During iterative development cycles

## Process
1. **Scan:** Identify the specific change that needs documentation
2. **Draft:** Update only the affected documentation sections
3. **Ask:** Clarify any details about the specific change
4. **Sync:** Ensure the specific change is accurately documented

## Expected Outcomes
- Updated documentation for the specific change
- Maintained consistency with the rest of the documentation
- Clear description of what changed and why
- Updated test cases if applicable

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Delta Pass - Documented new pagination parameter in search API`
