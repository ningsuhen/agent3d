# Clarity Quest

**Purpose:** Triggered when existing documentation is **ambiguous or incomplete**, requiring extensive clarification, often involving a detailed "Ask" phase with the human.

## When to Use
- When documentation contains ambiguities or inconsistencies
- When requirements are unclear or contradictory
- When technical specifications lack necessary detail
- Before implementation of complex features with unclear documentation

## Process
1. **Scan:** Identify ambiguities, inconsistencies, or gaps in documentation
2. **Draft:** Document questions and potential interpretations
3. **Ask:** Engage in detailed discussion to resolve ambiguities
4. **Sync:** Update documentation with clarified information

## Expected Outcomes
- Resolved ambiguities in documentation
- Consistent terminology and specifications
- Clear acceptance criteria for features
- Documented answers to previously unclear aspects

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Clarity Quest - Resolved ambiguities in payment processing requirements`
