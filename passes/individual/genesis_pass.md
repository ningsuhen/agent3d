# Genesis Pass

**Purpose:** For **initial creation** of core documentation for a new feature or project. It's about laying the foundation from scratch.

## When to Use
- Starting a new project or feature with no existing documentation
- Creating the initial set of required documentation files
- Establishing the foundational documentation structure

## Process
1. **Scan:** Identify what documentation is missing completely
2. **Draft:** Create full versions of all required primary documentation
3. **Ask:** Clarify any uncertainties about project scope, architecture, or requirements
4. **Sync:** Ensure initial documentation is comprehensive before any code is written

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete set of primary documentation files
- Clear project vision and scope
- Defined architecture and technical approach
- Initial feature list and task backlog
- Test case framework

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Genesis Pass - Created initial documentation framework for project`
