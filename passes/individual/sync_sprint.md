# Sync Sprint

**Purpose:** A **rapid, focused pass** to quickly bring code and documentation back into immediate alignment after minor drift.

## When to Use
- After quick code changes that weren't documented
- When documentation needs minor updates to match implementation
- For routine alignment of code and documentation
- During regular maintenance cycles

## Process
1. **Scan:** Identify minor discrepancies between code and documentation
2. **Draft:** Make targeted updates to documentation
3. **Ask:** Clarify any uncertainties about implementation details
4. **Sync:** Ensure documentation accurately reflects current code

## Expected Outcomes
- Documentation that accurately reflects current implementation
- Updated status markers in task lists
- Corrected technical details in specifications
- Aligned feature descriptions with actual functionality

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Sync Sprint - Updated API documentation to match current endpoints`
