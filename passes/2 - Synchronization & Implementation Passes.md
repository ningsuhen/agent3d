These passes ensure that code, tests, and deployment artifacts accurately reflect the documentation.

* **Sync Sprint:** A **rapid, focused pass** to quickly bring code and documentation back into immediate alignment after minor drift.
* **Delta Pass:** When a **small, incremental change** has occurred in either code or documentation, focusing solely on reconciling that specific difference.
* **Rendition Resolve:** A **more intensive pass** needed when there's significant divergence between code and documentation, requiring a comprehensive reconciliation.
