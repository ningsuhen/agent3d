These passes focus on establishing, refining, or strategizing the "single source of truth" within the documentation.

* **Genesis Pass:** For **initial creation** of core documentation for a new feature or project. It's about laying the foundation from scratch.
* **Blueprint Pass:** Dedicated to defining and documenting **architectural design** and significant technical decisions, with a primary focus on `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
* **Feature Forge:** Specifically for **detailing a new feature**, from its high-level concept to its entry in `docs/FEATURES.md`.
* **Discovery Dive:** When the main goal is to **uncover and document unknown requirements**, technical constraints, or design alternatives.
* **Roadmap Readout:** For **updating and aligning** `docs/TASKS.md` or `docs/FEATURES.md` based on new project priorities, milestones, or strategic shifts.
* **Clarity Quest:** Triggered when existing documentation is **ambiguous or incomplete**, requiring extensive clarification, often involving a detailed "Ask" phase with the human.
