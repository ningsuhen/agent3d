# Full Pass

**Purpose:** A comprehensive pass that encompasses all aspects of documentation-driven development, from foundation to quality assurance, ensuring complete alignment between documentation and code.

**Encompasses:** All other passes (Foundation, Documentation, Synchronization, Quality, Prune)

## When to Use
- For major project milestones or releases
- When onboarding a new codebase or project
- During significant overhauls of existing systems
- For annual or semi-annual documentation health checks
- When preparing for external audits or reviews

## Process
1. **Scan:**
   - Comprehensively review the entire codebase and documentation
   - Identify all gaps, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement
   - Map the current state of documentation against code
   - Identify outdated or redundant documentation

2. **Draft:**
   - Create or update foundational documentation (architecture, features)
   - Document all requirements, features, and priorities
   - Clarify ambiguities and resolve inconsistencies
   - Align documentation with current implementation
   - Improve quality and mark outdated content for removal

3. **Ask:**
   - Engage stakeholders for clarification on all aspects
   - Validate assumptions and decisions
   - Seek feedback on documentation quality and completeness
   - Confirm which documentation is safe to remove

4. **Sync:**
   - Ensure complete alignment between documentation and code
   - Refine documentation for clarity and relevance
   - Validate all documentation against implementation
   - Remove outdated content

## Expected Outcomes
- Fully aligned documentation and code
- Complete and accurate architectural documentation
- Comprehensive feature documentation
- Updated roadmap and priorities
- Resolved ambiguities
- Improved documentation quality and readability
- Removed outdated or redundant content
- Validated consistency across all documentation

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Full Pass - Comprehensive documentation update for v3.0 release`

## Execution Strategy
A Full Pass is extensive and may be executed in phases, focusing on different aspects:

1. **Foundation Phase**
   - Update architectural documentation
   - Establish or refresh core documentation structure

2. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document all features and requirements
   - Update priorities and roadmap
   - Resolve ambiguities

3. **Synchronization Phase**
   - Align documentation with current implementation
   - Reconcile any divergences

4. **Quality Phase**
   - Verify documentation accuracy
   - Improve quality

5. **Prune Phase**
   - Remove outdated or redundant content
   - Archive historical information when appropriate

Each phase follows the Scan → Draft → Ask → Sync workflow, building upon the previous phase.
