# Foundation Pass

**Purpose:** Establish project foundation through configuration discovery, feature selection, and initial project setup after requirements are understood. Configure Agent3D features based on requirements and establish the project's operational framework and basic structure.

**Role:** Assume the role of a **Project Setup Specialist** with expertise in project initialization, configuration management, and foundation establishment. Focus on understanding project context, configuring appropriate tooling, establishing basic project structure, and setting the foundation for all subsequent DDD passes. Think like a setup expert who ensures the project starts with the right configuration, scope, and foundational elements.

## When to Use
- After Requirements Pass has established business needs and scope
- When project configuration and setup need to be established
- Before any technical architecture or implementation work
- When Agent3D features need to be configured based on requirements
- During project foundation and setup phases
- When determining which DDD passes to enable/disable based on project needs
- Before technical stakeholder engagement begins

## Process
1. **Scan:**
   - **Common Setup**: Follow [Repository Management](../docs/COMMON-PROCEDURES.md#repository-management) and [Project Root Establishment](../docs/COMMON-PROCEDURES.md#project-root-establishment)
   - Review requirements documentation from Requirements Pass
   - Check for existing `.agent3d-config.yml` configuration file in project root
   - Identify project type, language, and technology stack based on requirements
   - Assess current project structure and existing documentation
   - Determine which Agent3D features are needed based on requirements scope

2. **Draft:**
   - **Configuration Discovery**: Ask user questions one by one to determine:
     - Project type (web app, API, library, CLI tool, etc.)
     - Primary programming language and framework
     - Development methodology (agile, waterfall, etc.)
     - Team size and structure
     - Quality requirements and standards
   - **Feature Selection**: Configure which DDD passes to enable:
     - Skip coding passes for documentation-only projects
     - Skip testing passes for proof-of-concept work
     - Enable/disable specific language rules
     - Configure quality thresholds and validation levels
   - **Foundation Setup**: Create basic project structure:
     - Create `.agent3d-config.yml` with selected configuration
     - Establish `docs/` directory structure
     - Create initial `.agent3d` project marker file
     - Set up basic project foundation files

3. **Ask:**
   - **Interactive Configuration**: Present configuration options one question at a time:
     - "What type of project is this? (web app/API/library/CLI/other)"
     - "What is the primary programming language?"
     - "Do you want to enable automated testing passes? (y/n)"
     - "Do you want to enable code implementation passes? (y/n)"
     - "What quality level do you prefer? (strict/balanced/relaxed)"
     - "Are there specific DDD passes you want to skip?"
   - Validate configuration choices with user
   - Confirm project scope and boundaries

4. **Sync:**
   - Save final configuration to `.agent3d-config.yml` in project root
   - Create initial project structure based on configuration
   - Establish basic documentation framework
   - Create initial `DDD-STATUS.md` with Foundation Pass completion
   - Validate project setup and configuration consistency
   - Prepare handoff to subsequent passes with clear project scope

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with âœ… to track progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Project Configuration:**
  - `.agent3d-config.yml` file with complete project configuration in project root
  - Enabled/disabled DDD passes based on project needs
  - Language-specific rules and quality thresholds configured
  - Project type and methodology documented
- **Foundation Structure:**
  - Initial project directory structure established
  - Agent3D features configured for project context
  - Quality gates and validation levels set appropriately
- **Configuration Documentation:**
  - Clear record of configuration decisions and rationale in `.agent3d-config.yml`
  - Project scope and boundaries established
  - Foundation for all subsequent DDD passes prepared

## Related Passes
- **Follows:** [Requirements Pass](0_requirements_pass.md) - After business requirements are established
- **Next:** [Documentation Pass](2_documentation_pass.md) - Feature documentation follows foundation setup
- **Informs:** All subsequent DDD passes based on configuration choices
- **Configuration:** See [Configuration Guide](../../docs/CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md) for detailed configuration options

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Foundation Pass - Configured Agent3D for Python web application with testing and code review enabled`

## Configuration Questions Framework

### Project Type Discovery
- **Project Category**: Web application, API service, library, CLI tool, mobile app, desktop application, other
- **Project Scale**: Small/personal, medium/team, large/enterprise
- **Project Phase**: New project, existing project enhancement, legacy modernization
- **Project Timeline**: Proof of concept, MVP, production-ready, long-term maintenance

### Technology Stack Configuration
- **Primary Language**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go, C#, Rust, other
- **Framework/Platform**: Framework-specific configurations (Django, React, Spring Boot, etc.)
- **Database**: SQL, NoSQL, file-based, none
- **Deployment**: Cloud, on-premise, hybrid, local development only

### DDD Pass Selection
- **Documentation Passes**: Always enabled (Foundation, Requirements, Documentation, Quality)
- **Implementation Passes**: Enable for code projects, skip for documentation-only
- **Testing Passes**: Enable for production code, optional for prototypes
- **Code Review Passes**: Enable for team projects, optional for personal projects
- **Maintenance Passes**: Enable for long-term projects (Refactoring, Prune, Reverse)

### Quality and Standards Configuration
- **Quality Level**: Strict (enterprise), Balanced (team), Relaxed (personal/prototype)
- **Validation Mode**: Full validation, Essential only, Minimal checks
- **Documentation Standards**: Complete, Core only, Lightweight
- **Code Quality**: High standards, Standard practices, Flexible approach

## Interactive Configuration Process

### Step-by-Step Question Flow
1. **Project Context**: "What type of project are you working on?"
2. **Language Selection**: "What is your primary programming language?"
3. **Team Structure**: "Is this a personal project or team project?"
4. **Quality Requirements**: "What quality level do you need? (strict/balanced/relaxed)"
5. **Pass Selection**: "Which DDD passes do you want to enable?"
6. **Custom Configuration**: "Any specific configuration requirements?"

### Configuration Validation
- Validate configuration choices for consistency
- Warn about potential conflicts or missing dependencies
- Suggest optimal configurations based on project type
- Confirm final configuration before saving
