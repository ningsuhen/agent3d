# Foundation Pass

**Purpose:** Creating or establishing foundational documentation, including architecture, technical decisions, and core documentation structure.

**Equivalent to:** Previous Foundation Pass

## When to Use
- Starting a new project or feature with no existing documentation
- Making significant architectural changes to existing systems
- Establishing the foundational documentation structure
- Documenting major technical decisions and their rationales

## Process
1. **Scan:**
   - Identify what documentation is missing or needs architectural updates
2. **Draft:**
   - Create full versions of all required primary documentation
   - Develop architectural diagrams, data flows, and design decisions
   - Document technical decisions and trade-offs
3. **Ask:**
   - Clarify project scope, architecture, or requirements
   - Discuss technical constraints, integration points, or design alternatives
4. **Sync:**
   - Ensure documentation is comprehensive before code implementation
   - Verify architectural documentation is complete and accurate

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with âœ… to track progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete set of primary documentation files
- Comprehensive architectural documentation with clear diagrams
- Defined system components and their interactions
- Clear data flow and process models
- Documented technical decisions and trade-offs

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Foundation Pass - Created initial documentation and architecture for payment processing system`
