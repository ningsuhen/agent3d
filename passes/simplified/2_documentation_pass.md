   - Identify where new features fit within current structure
   - Note ambiguities or unclear requirements

2. **Draft:**
   - Create detailed feature specifications with acceptance criteria
   - Document technical requirements and integration points
   - Update priorities, timelines, and dependencies
   - Prepare questions for unclear areas

3. **Ask:**
   - Clarify feature scope, priorities, and edge cases
   - Resolve ambiguities through stakeholder discussion
   - Confirm technical constraints and dependencies

4. **Sync:**
   - Update `FEATURES.md` and relevant documentation
   - Ensure documentation reflects current project roadmap
   - Document all clarified information and decisions

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with âœ… to track progress.
