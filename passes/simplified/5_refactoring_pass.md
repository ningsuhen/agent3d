# Refactoring Pass

**Purpose:** Cleaning up and improving code structure without changing functionality, focusing on maintainability, readability, and performance. For documentation projects, includes LLM-focused compression to remove verbose explanations of tasks that LLMs inherently understand.

**Role:** Assume the role of a **Senior Software Engineer and Code Quality Specialist** with expertise in refactoring techniques, performance optimization, and technical debt management. Focus on improving code quality while preserving functionality. Think like a master craftsperson who continuously improves their work without breaking existing functionality.

   - **Documentation Streamlining:** Identify redundant documentation sections to merge or remove

3. **Ask:**
   - **Consolidation Approval:** Confirm which files/modules should be combined
   - **Structural Changes:** Verify proposed modularization and reorganization
   - **DRY Implementation:** Validate approach to eliminate duplication
   - **Priority Alignment:** Ensure refactoring priorities match project goals
   - **Breaking Changes:** Discuss any changes that might affect existing workflows

4. **Sync:**
   - **Incremental Implementation:** Apply refactoring changes in small, testable increments
   - **DRY Enforcement:** Eliminate identified duplication across code and documentation
   - **LLM Compression Implementation:** Remove verbose explanations, keeping only essential commands and concepts
   - **Modular Restructuring:** Implement planned consolidation and modularization
   - **Testing Verification:** Run all tests to ensure functionality is preserved
   - **Documentation Updates:** Update all affected documentation to reflect changes
   - **Cross-Reference Validation:** Ensure all links and references remain functional

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with âœ… to track progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Repository Optimization:** Streamlined repository structure with improved organization
- **Documentation Clarity:** Consolidated and modularized documentation with eliminated redundancy
- **LLM-Optimized Content:** Compressed documentation focused on essential information for LLM consumption

- **Naming Improvements:** Enhance variable, function, and class names
- **Error Handling Consistency:** Standardize error handling patterns

### Documentation and Testing
- **Documentation Clarity:** Improve readability and eliminate redundancy
- **LLM-Focused Compression:** Remove verbose explanations of basic tasks that LLMs inherently understand
- **Test Consolidation:** Combine overlapping test cases
- **Language-Specific Compliance:** Follow language-specific guidelines consistently
- **Cross-Reference Optimization:** Ensure all links and references are efficient

### LLM-Focused Documentation Compression
- **Language-Specific Rules:** Apply compression rules from `~/.agent3d/rules/markdown.md`
- **Review Guidelines:** Follow `~/.agent3d/rules/markdown-review-guidelines.md` for optimization criteria
- **Basic Task Compression:** Remove detailed explanations of standard development tasks
- **Command Simplification:** Replace verbose command explanations with concise references
- **Essential Information Only:** Keep only commands, parameters, and project-specific details

## Verification Approach
- Run all existing tests to ensure functionality is preserved
- Verify performance metrics before and after changes
- Review changes with team members
- Ensure documentation remains accurate
- Validate that all requirements are still met

## Guidelines

### Repository Review Principles
- **Comprehensive Audit:** Review every file in the repository for optimization opportunities
- **DRY Enforcement:** Eliminate all forms of duplication (code, documentation, configuration)
- **Modular Thinking:** Always consider if components can be combined or split for better clarity
- **Brevity Focus:** Prioritize concise, clear communication over verbose explanations

### Implementation Approach
- **Incremental Changes:** Make small, testable changes with frequent verification
- **One Area at a Time:** Focus on specific components to avoid overwhelming changes
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain existing functionality and interfaces
- **No Feature Addition:** Strictly refactor without adding new functionality
- **Reversible Changes:** Keep changes easily reversible when possible

### Quality Standards
- **Documentation Consistency:** Ensure uniform style and structure across all documentation
- **Code Standards:** Follow language-specific rules and best practices consistently
- **Architectural Alignment:** Maintain consistency with overall system design
- **Performance Mindset:** Always consider performance implications of changes
- **Testing Preservation:** Ensure all existing tests continue to pass

### Validation Requirements
- **Functionality Verification:** All existing functionality must remain intact
- **Performance Measurement:** Track performance metrics before and after changes
- **Documentation Accuracy:** Ensure all documentation reflects actual implementation
- **Cross-Reference Integrity:** Validate that all links and references remain functional

## LLM Documentation Compression Guidelines

### Language-Specific Compression Rules
For detailed compression guidelines and examples, refer to language-specific rules:

- **Markdown Projects:** See `~/.agent3d/rules/markdown.md` for comprehensive LLM optimization rules
- **Python Projects:** See `~/.agent3d/rules/python.md` for Python-specific compression guidelines
- **JavaScript Projects:** See `~/.agent3d/rules/javascript.md` for JS/TS compression rules
- **Other Languages:** Apply general principles with language-appropriate adaptations

### General Compression Principles
- **Assume LLM Competency:** LLMs understand standard development tools and practices
- **Focus on Specifics:** Keep project-specific details, remove generic explanations
- **Command-Centric:** Provide commands and parameters, not installation or basic usage instructions
- **Context-Aware:** Maintain enough context for task completion without verbose explanations

### Compression Application
1. **Review Current Content:** Identify verbose explanations of standard tasks
2. **Apply Language Rules:** Use appropriate language-specific compression guidelines
3. **Preserve Essentials:** Keep commands, project-specific details, and critical warnings
4. **Validate Functionality:** Ensure compressed content remains actionable and complete
