# Implementation Pass

**Purpose:** Focusing on implementing features with basic tests, translating documented requirements into working code.

**Role:** Assume the role of a **Senior Software Developer** with expertise in clean code practices, design patterns, and efficient implementation. Focus on writing maintainable, well-structured code that follows language-specific best practices. Think like a craftsperson who takes pride in elegant, robust solutions.

## When to Use
- When feature documentation is complete and ready for implementation
- After a Foundation Pass or Documentation Pass has established clear requirements
- When starting the development phase of a feature
- When converting a proof of concept into production code

## Process
1. **Scan:** [Repository Management](../docs/COMMON-PROCEDURES.md#repository-management), review documentation, identify priorities, check TEST-CASES.md
2. **Draft:** Create implementation plan, identify test scenarios, plan error handling
3. **Ask:** Clarify requirements, confirm approach, verify dependencies
4. **Sync:** Implement features, write tests, ensure standards compliance

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with ✅ to track progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- Working implementation
- Basic test coverage
- Passing tests
- Standards compliance
- Updated documentation
