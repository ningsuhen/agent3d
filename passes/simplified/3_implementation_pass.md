# Implementation Pass

**Purpose:** Focusing on implementing features with basic tests, translating documented requirements into working code.

## When to Use
- When feature documentation is complete and ready for implementation
- After a Foundation Pass or Documentation Pass has established clear requirements
- When starting the development phase of a feature
- When converting a proof of concept into production code

## Process
1. **Scan:**
   - **Repository Update**: `git -C ~/.agent3d pull origin main`
   - Review feature documentation and requirements
   - Identify implementation priorities and dependencies
   - Review existing test cases in TEST-CASES.md

2. **Draft:**
   - Create implementation plan with component breakdown
   - Identify key test scenarios for basic validation
   - Plan for basic error handling and edge cases

3. **Ask:** Clarify requirements, confirm technical approach, verify dependencies

4. **Sync:** Implement features, write basic tests, ensure code standards compliance

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with âœ… to track progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- Working implementation of the documented feature
- Basic test coverage for core functionality
- Passing tests for the happy path scenarios
- Code that follows project standards and conventions
- Updated documentation reflecting implementation details

## Related Passes
- **Follows:** [Documentation Pass](2_documentation_pass.md) - After feature documentation is complete
- **Precedes:** [Testing Pass](4_testing_pass.md) - Before comprehensive testing
- **Language Rules:** See `rules/` directory for language-specific development guidelines

## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Implementation Pass - Implemented user authentication feature with basic test coverage`

## Testing Focus
- Focus on "happy path" test cases
- Implement basic validation tests
- Cover core functionality and main use cases
- Establish foundation for more comprehensive testing
- Ensure all implemented code has at least basic test coverage

## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow language-specific rules from the rules directory
- Implement only what is documented in the requirements
- Keep code lean and avoid speculative abstractions
- Document any technical decisions made during implementation
- Ensure code is readable and maintainable
