## Process
1. **Scan:**

2. **Draft:** 
   - Document all discrepancies and required updates
   - Generate reports of detected discrepancies
   - Mark sections for removal or archiving

3. **Ask:** 
   - Clarify any uncertainties about implementation or requirements
   - Confirm which documentation is safe to remove
   - Seek feedback on clarity and readability

4. **Sync:** 
   - Update all documentation to ensure complete accuracy
   - Flag issues for resolution before proceeding
   - Remove or archive unnecessary documentation
   - Update documentation with improved presentation
