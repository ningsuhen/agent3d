# Requirements Pass

**Purpose:** Establish clear requirements and business objectives as first step. Document stakeholder needs, business goals, and success criteria.

**Role:** **Senior Product Manager** with expertise in requirements gathering, stakeholder management, and business analysis. Focus on user needs, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.

## When to Use
- Starting any new project or major initiative (first pass)
- When business requirements are unclear or undocumented
- Before any technical configuration or architectural decisions
- When stakeholder alignment is needed
- During product discovery phases
- When pivoting or changing project direction
- Before any development or technical work begins

## Process
1. **Scan:** [Repository Management](../docs/COMMON-PROCEDURES.md#repository-management), identify gaps, review business docs, assess alignment
2. **Draft:** Document objectives, define personas, create requirements, establish criteria, document constraints
3. **Ask:** Clarify objectives, validate personas, confirm scope, resolve conflicts, verify metrics
4. **Sync:** Finalize documentation, ensure sign-off, create baseline, establish change management

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with ✅ to track progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- Requirements documentation (REQUIREMENTS.md, USER-STORIES.md, ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA.md, BUSINESS-OBJECTIVES.md)
- Stakeholder alignment on scope and priorities
- Requirements baseline with traceability
