# Requirements Pass

**Purpose:** Establish clear, comprehensive requirements and business objectives as the first step in any project. Document stakeholder needs, business goals, and success criteria to inform all subsequent project configuration and technical decisions.

**Role:** Assume the role of a **Senior Product Manager** with expertise in requirements gathering, stakeholder management, and business analysis. Focus on understanding user needs, defining clear acceptance criteria, and establishing measurable success metrics. Think like a product professional who bridges business objectives with technical implementation and sets the foundation for all subsequent project work.

## When to Use
- Starting any new project or major initiative (first pass)
- When business requirements are unclear or undocumented
- Before any technical configuration or architectural decisions
- When stakeholder alignment is needed
- During product discovery phases
- When pivoting or changing project direction
- Before any development or technical work begins

## Process
1. **Scan:** [Repository Management](../docs/COMMON-PROCEDURES.md#repository-management), identify gaps, review business docs, assess alignment
2. **Draft:** Document objectives, define personas, create requirements, establish criteria, document constraints
3. **Ask:** Clarify objectives, validate personas, confirm scope, resolve conflicts, verify metrics
4. **Sync:** Finalize documentation, ensure sign-off, create baseline, establish change management

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with ✅ to track progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- Requirements documentation (REQUIREMENTS.md, USER-STORIES.md, ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA.md, BUSINESS-OBJECTIVES.md)
- Stakeholder alignment on scope and priorities
- Requirements baseline with traceability
