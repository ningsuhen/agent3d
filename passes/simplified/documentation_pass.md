# Documentation Pass

**Purpose:** Documenting features, requirements, priorities, and clarifying existing documentation to ensure completeness and clarity.

**Combines:** Feature Documentation Pass + Roadmap Pass + Clarity Pass

## When to Use
- Adding a new feature to the project
- Exploring unfamiliar technical domains
- After project planning meetings or sprint planning
- When priorities or project scope changes
- When documentation contains ambiguities or inconsistencies
- When requirements are unclear or contradictory
- Before implementation of complex features with unclear documentation

## Process
1. **Scan:** 
   - Identify where new features fit in existing documentation
   - Review current task and feature documentation
   - Identify ambiguities, inconsistencies, or gaps in documentation
   - Identify knowledge gaps in current documentation

2. **Draft:** 
   - Create detailed feature specifications including user stories, acceptance criteria
   - Document findings, constraints, and alternatives
   - Update priorities, timelines, and feature statuses
   - Document questions and potential interpretations for unclear areas
   - Document technical requirements and integration points

3. **Ask:** 
   - Clarify feature scope, priorities, and edge cases
   - Clarify new priorities, dependencies, or strategic changes
   - Engage in detailed discussion to resolve ambiguities
   - Seek clarification on technical uncertainties or domain-specific questions

4. **Sync:** 
   - Update `FEATURES.md` and other relevant documentation
   - Document newly discovered information and constraints
   - Ensure documentation reflects the current project roadmap
   - Update documentation with clarified information

## Expected Outcomes
- Detailed feature entries in `FEATURES.md`
- Associated test cases in `TEST-CASES.md`
- Documented technical constraints and limitations
- Updated `TASKS.md` with current priorities
- Revised feature documentation reflecting scope changes
- Resolved ambiguities in documentation
- Consistent terminology and specifications
- Clear acceptance criteria for features

## Example Commit Message
