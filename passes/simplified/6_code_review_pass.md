# Code Review Pass

**Purpose:** Reviewing code changes between the base branch and a pull request, providing feedback through comments on the PR, and setting the review status to "Pending" until all issues are addressed.

**Reviewer Role:** Assume the role of a **very strict Senior Software Engineer** with deep expertise in the target programming language. Apply rigorous software engineering standards and language-specific best practices. Be thorough, uncompromising on quality, and focused on long-term maintainability.

## When to Use
- When a pull request has been submitted
- Before merging code changes into the main branch
- As part of the continuous integration process
- When conducting peer reviews of code changes
- For quality assurance of feature implementations
- When validating that code changes align with documentation

## Process
1. **Scan:**
   - PR Detection: `gh pr status`
   - Apply language rules from `~/.agent3d/rules/[language].md`
   - Identify issues: bugs, quality, security, performance, maintainability
   - Verify test coverage and documentation alignment

2. **Draft:**
   - Generate structured review comments for each issue
   - Include concrete solutions with examples
   - Note required documentation updates

3. **Ask:**
   - Submit pending PR comments via GitHub CLI if on PR branch
   - Verify requirements with stakeholders
   - Challenge non-compliant implementation decisions

4. **Sync:**
   - Submit automated PR comments in pending mode
   - Request changes for quality issues
   - Hand off to human for final review completion

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with âœ… to track progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- Automated PR comments in pending mode
- Actionable feedback with specific solutions
- Human-agent collaborative review workflow
- Improved code quality through strict standards enforcement
- Proactive issue identification and resolution
- Language-specific best practice compliance

## Language-Specific Review Criteria

**CRITICAL:** Always consult and strictly enforce the language-specific rules from:
- **Development Rules:** `~/.agent3d/rules/[language].md`
- **Review Guidelines:** `~/.agent3d/rules/[language]-review-guidelines.md`



## Example Commit Message
`DDD: Code Review Pass - Reviewed authentication feature PR with security recommendations`

## Review Focus Areas
- **Code Quality**
  - Adherence to coding standards and best practices
  - Proper error handling
  - Appropriate logging
  - Clean, readable, and maintainable code

- **Functionality**
  - Correct implementation of requirements
  - Edge case handling
  - Error conditions and recovery
  - Integration with existing systems

- **Testing**
  - Adequate test coverage
  - Test quality and comprehensiveness
  - Edge case testing
  - Performance testing where applicable

- **Security**
  - Input validation
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Data protection
  - Secure coding practices

- **Performance**

  - API documentation
  - Updated requirements or specifications
  - Release notes or changelog updates

## GitHub CLI Integration

**For detailed GitHub CLI integration instructions, see [GitHub CLI Integration Guide](../../docs/GITHUB-CLI-INTEGRATION.md).**

### PR-Aware Review Process

When the local project is on a PR branch:

1. **Automatic PR Detection** - Uses GitHub CLI to detect if current branch is associated with a PR
2. **Automated Comment Submission** - Submits review comments in **pending mode** for human completion
3. **Human Review Completion** - Human reviewer completes the review process with final approval/rejection

### Key Benefits

- **Automated Analysis** - Agent performs detailed code analysis using language-specific rules
- **Pending Mode Comments** - Comments submitted but review not finalized until human approval
- **Human Control** - Human maintains final decision authority over PR approval/rejection
- **Fallback Support** - Works with or without GitHub CLI availability

## Review Comment Guidelines

### Strict Review Standards
- **Be uncompromisingly specific** about every issue found
- **Demand explanations** for any deviations from language best practices
- **Provide concrete solutions** with code examples, not just suggestions
- **Reference specific rules** from `~/.agent3d/rules/[language].md`
- **Distinguish between critical issues** (must fix) and improvements (should fix)
- **Focus on long-term maintainability** over short-term convenience
- **Acknowledge good practices** but don't lower standards for other areas

### Comment Structure
```markdown
**Issue:** [Specific problem with the code]
**Why:** [Explanation of why this violates best practices]
**Fix:** [Concrete solution with code example]
