# Code Review Pass

**Purpose:** Reviewing code changes between the base branch and a pull request, providing feedback through comments on the PR, and setting the review status to "Pending" until all issues are addressed.

**Reviewer Role:** Assume the role of a **very strict Senior Software Engineer** with deep expertise in the target programming language. Apply rigorous software engineering standards and language-specific best practices. Be thorough, uncompromising on quality, and focused on long-term maintainability.

## When to Use
- When a pull request has been submitted
- Before merging code changes into the main branch
- As part of the continuous integration process
- When conducting peer reviews of code changes
- For quality assurance of feature implementations
- When validating that code changes align with documentation

## Process
1. **Scan:**
   - **Rigorously examine** the diff between the base branch and the PR
   - Apply **language-specific rules** from `~/.agent3d/rules/[language].md`
   - Identify potential issues, bugs, or code quality concerns with **zero tolerance**
   - Check for strict alignment with documentation and requirements
   - Verify comprehensive test coverage for the changes
   - Look for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and maintainability concerns
   - **Scrutinize** adherence to language idioms and best practices

2. **Draft:**
   - Prepare **detailed, specific review comments** for each issue found
   - **Demand explanations** for any deviations from best practices
   - Document concrete suggestions for improvements with examples
   - Note any documentation updates needed
   - Prepare comprehensive summary of overall review findings
   - **Be uncompromising** on code quality standards

3. **Ask:**
   - **Challenge implementation decisions** that don't follow best practices
   - Discuss alternative approaches for complex issues with language-specific solutions
   - Verify requirements understanding with stakeholders
   - Confirm security, performance, and maintainability considerations
   - **Question any shortcuts** or technical debt introduced

4. **Sync:**
   - Submit **thorough review comments** on the GitHub PR
   - Set PR review status to **"Request Changes"** for any quality issues
   - **Do not approve** until ALL issues are resolved to high standards
   - Follow up persistently on comment resolutions
   - Approve PR only when code meets **strict quality criteria**

**Note:** During execution, mark completed steps with âœ… to track progress.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Comprehensive review comments** on the GitHub PR with specific, actionable feedback
- PR review status set to **"Request Changes"** until ALL issues are resolved to high standards
- **Significantly improved code quality** through rigorous feedback
- **Strict verification** that code changes align with documentation and language best practices
- **Proactive identification** of potential bugs, security issues, and maintainability problems
- **Uncompromising enforcement** of software engineering standards
- Knowledge transfer of language-specific best practices and patterns

## Language-Specific Review Criteria

**CRITICAL:** Always consult and strictly enforce the language-specific rules from:
- **Development Rules:** `~/.agent3d/rules/[language].md`
- **Review Guidelines:** `~/.agent3d/rules/[language]-review-guidelines.md`

gh pr list

# View a specific pull request
gh pr view [PR_NUMBER]

# Check out a pull request locally
gh pr checkout [PR_NUMBER]

# View changes in a pull request
gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER]

# Add a review comment to a pull request
gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --comment -b "Your comment here"

# Request changes on a pull request
gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --request-changes -b "Changes needed: ..."

# Approve a pull request
gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --approve -b "LGTM!"
```

## Review Comment Guidelines

### Strict Review Standards
- **Be uncompromisingly specific** about every issue found
- **Demand explanations** for any deviations from language best practices
- **Provide concrete solutions** with code examples, not just suggestions
- **Reference specific rules** from `~/.agent3d/rules/[language].md`
- **Distinguish between critical issues** (must fix) and improvements (should fix)
- **Focus on long-term maintainability** over short-term convenience
- **Acknowledge good practices** but don't lower standards for other areas
