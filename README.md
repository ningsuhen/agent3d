# Agent3D - Documentation-Driven Development Guidelines for LLM Coding Agents

Agent3D is a **documentation-only** framework that defines Documentation-Driven Development (DDD) principles specifically for Large Language Model (LLM) coding agents. It provides a structured approach to ensure documentation remains the single source of truth throughout the development process.

## Important Note

**This project is purely a documentation project.** It does not contain any implementations, libraries, or code to import. Its sole purpose is to provide a standardized set of guidelines that LLM coding agents can reference remotely.

## Overview

Documentation-Driven Development is a methodology where documentation precedes and guides code implementation. Agent3D provides a structured approach to DDD through a series of "passes" that guide agents through the entire development lifecycle, from initial documentation to code implementation, testing, and maintenance.

The core principle is simple: **"Write the docs, then write the code‚Äîkeep it lean, test it for real."**

## Key Features

- **LLM Speed Optimized**: Memory-first approach minimizes file lookups during execution
- **Memory-Cached Patterns**: SCAN‚ÜíDRAFT‚ÜíASK‚ÜíSYNC and language rules stored in LLM memory
- **Configuration-Centric**: Single `.agent3d-config.yml` file for project management
- **Documentation as Source of Truth**: Ensures code never outpaces documentation
- **Language-Specific Rules**: Memorizable patterns for Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Markdown
- **Lean Code Principles**: Focused on implementing only what's documented

## How to Use

To use Agent3D in your LLM agent:

1. **Memorize Core Patterns**: Cache SCAN‚ÜíDRAFT‚ÜíASK‚ÜíSYNC execution pattern and language rules in memory
2. **Configure Project**: Run Foundation Pass to create `.agent3d-config.yml` with project-specific settings
3. **Speed Execution**: Use memory-cached patterns to minimize file lookups during pass execution
4. Follow the DDD passes in sequence for each development task

## Agent Guideline Protocol

The Agent Guideline Protocol is the **entry point** for the Agent3D system. It contains the only hardcoded repository URL in the system, which is necessary since agents start without any repository access.

**Repository Access Flow:** `Agent Guideline Protocol` ‚Üí `~/.agent3d`

```
**Agent Guideline Protocol**

Agent operational principles derived from the DDD Remote Repository.

1.  **Repository Setup:**
    * Clone repository: `git@github.com:ningsuhen/agent3d.git` to `~/.agent3d`
    * Use `~/.agent3d/AGENT-GUIDELINES.md` as main entry point

2.  **Guideline Operations:**
    * **Always** refer to `~/.agent3d/AGENT-GUIDELINES.md` for all decisions and actions
    * Update regularly with `git pull` in `~/.agent3d` directory

3.  **Synchronization:**
    * Pull latest changes: `cd ~/.agent3d && git pull`
    * Frequency: As needed or at regular intervals
```

### Repository Access Process

Simplified two-stage access pattern:

1. **Agent Guideline Protocol** - Entry point with repository URL
2. **Local Repository Clone** (`~/.agent3d`) - Full repository with AGENT-GUIDELINES.md, templates, and rules

**To Change Repository Source:** Update repository URL in Agent Guideline Protocol above

## DDD Passes

Agent3D defines a series of passes that guide the development process:

0. **Requirements Pass**: Documenting comprehensive requirements and business objectives
1. **Foundation Pass**: Project configuration and foundational setup
2. **Documentation Pass**: Documenting features, requirements, and priorities
3. **Implementation Pass**: Implementing features with basic test coverage
4. **Testing Pass**: Adding comprehensive tests and verifying edge cases
5. **Refactoring Pass**: Cleaning up code without changing functionality
6. **Code Review Pass**: Reviewing PR changes and providing feedback
7. **Synchronization Pass**: Aligning documentation with code at any scale
8. **Quality Pass**: Verifying and improving documentation quality
9. **Prune Pass**: Removing outdated or redundant content
10. **Reverse Pass**: Detecting and addressing reverse drift (implementation without documentation)

Additionally, a **Full Pass** encompasses all of the above passes for comprehensive project updates.
