## Documentation-Driven Development

This project defines Documentation-Driven Development (DDD) principles. All contributions should adhere to these principles:

1. Documentation precedes code implementation
2. Documentation is the single source of truth
3. Code should never outpace documentation

### Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Follow the existing documentation structure
- Use task lists (`- [ ]`) for features, tasks, and test cases
- Keep entries concise and clear
- Ensure language is clear and accessible for LLM agents to interpret
- Maintain consistent formatting across all documentation files

### Guidelines for Specific Documentation Types

#### Pass Documentation
- Maintain the numbered structure (1. Foundation Pass, 2. Documentation Pass, etc.)
- Include clear "When to Use" sections
- Ensure the "Process" sections follow the Scan → Draft → Ask → Sync workflow
- Include clear "Expected Outcomes" sections

#### Language-Specific Rules
- Keep rules organized by category (Environment Setup, Code Style, etc.)
- Ensure rules are specific and actionable
- Avoid ambiguous language that could be misinterpreted by LLM agents
