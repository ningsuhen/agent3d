## Documentation-Driven Development

This project follows Documentation-Driven Development (DDD) principles. All contributions should adhere to these principles:

1. Documentation precedes code implementation
2. Documentation is the single source of truth
3. Code should never outpace documentation

### DDD Process for Contributors

1. Start with updating or creating documentation for your feature or fix
2. Get documentation reviewed and approved
3. Implement code according to the documentation
4. Ensure tests cover the implementation
5. Submit both documentation and code changes together

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Follow language-specific rules in the `rules/` directory
- Keep code lean and avoid speculative abstractions
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Include appropriate comments for complex logic

### Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Follow the existing documentation structure
- Use task lists (`- [ ]`) for features, tasks, and test cases
- Keep entries concise and clear
