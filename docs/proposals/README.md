# Proposals Directory

This directory contains design proposals for unimplemented features, modules, and system changes. Proposals serve as a structured way to evaluate and plan future development work before implementation begins.

## Purpose

The proposals directory serves as:
- **Design Incubator**: A place to develop and refine ideas before implementation
- **Decision Documentation**: Record of why certain approaches were chosen or rejected
- **Implementation Planning**: Detailed roadmaps for complex features and modules
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Structured format for discussing and reviewing proposed changes

## Proposal Lifecycle

### 1. Draft Phase
- Create proposal using the [PROPOSAL Template](../../templates/PROPOSAL.template.md)
- Status: `Draft`
- Focus on problem definition and initial solution exploration
- Gather feedback from initial stakeholders

### 2. Review Phase
- Proposal is circulated for formal review
- Status: `Under Review`
- Stakeholders provide feedback and suggestions
- Technical feasibility is evaluated
- Resource requirements are assessed

### 3. Decision Phase
- Proposal is either approved or rejected
- Status: `Approved` or `Rejected`
- Decision rationale is documented
- If approved, implementation planning begins

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Approved proposals move into active development
- Status: `Implemented` once complete
- Content is integrated into main DDD documentation structure

## Integration Workflow

When a proposal is **approved and implemented**, its content should be integrated into the main DDD documentation:

### High-Level Design Integration
- Update `docs/HIGH-LEVEL-DESIGN.md` with new system components
- Add architectural diagrams showing new modules and their relationships
- Document integration points with existing systems

### Module Detailed Design Creation
- Create detailed design documents in `docs/modules/` using the [DETAILED-DESIGN Template](../../templates/DETAILED-DESIGN.template.md)
- Include API specifications, data flows, and implementation details
- Reference the original proposal for historical context

### Feature Documentation Update
- Add new features to `docs/FEATURES.md` with acceptance criteria
- Update feature status as implementation progresses
- Link features to their corresponding test cases

### Task and Test Integration
- Create implementation tasks in `docs/TASKS.md`
- Define test cases in `docs/TEST-CASES.md`
- Update `docs/DDD-STATUS.md` to track implementation progress

### Proposal Archival
- Move implemented proposals to `docs/proposals/archive/`
- Maintain links between archived proposals and implemented features
- Preserve decision history for future reference

## Directory Structure

```

├── README.md                    # This file
├── active/                      # Proposals under active consideration

└── templates/                   # Proposal-specific templates (if needed)
```

## Naming Conventions

### Proposal Files
- Use kebab-case for file names: `user-authentication-system.md`
- Include proposal type prefix if helpful: `feature-advanced-search.md`, `module-payment-gateway.md`
- Keep names descriptive but concise

### Status Tracking
Proposals must maintain status in their front matter:
- `Draft` - Initial proposal creation
- `Under Review` - Formal review process
- `Approved` - Approved for implementation
- `Rejected` - Rejected with documented reasons
- `Implemented` - Successfully implemented and integrated

## Review Process

### Review Criteria
- **Problem Clarity**: Is the problem well-defined and worth solving?
- **Solution Viability**: Is the proposed solution technically feasible?
- **Resource Alignment**: Do we have the resources to implement this?
- **Strategic Fit**: Does this align with project goals and priorities?
- **Risk Assessment**: Are risks identified and mitigated appropriately?

### Stakeholder Involvement
- **Technical Review**: Architecture, implementation approach, technical risks
- **Product Review**: Business value, user impact, feature alignment
- **Resource Review**: Timeline, team capacity, infrastructure requirements
- **Security Review**: Security implications and compliance requirements

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Proposals
1. **Start with the Problem**: Clearly articulate what problem you're solving
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why this problem matters now
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Document other approaches you considered
4. **Be Specific**: Include concrete details about implementation
5. **Address Risks**: Identify potential issues and mitigation strategies
6. **Define Success**: Specify measurable success criteria

### Proposal Maintenance
1. **Keep Status Current**: Update status as proposals progress
2. **Document Decisions**: Record why proposals were approved or rejected
3. **Link to Implementation**: Connect proposals to actual implementation work
4. **Archive Appropriately**: Move completed proposals to preserve history

### Integration Guidelines
1. **Gradual Integration**: Move content to main docs as implementation progresses
2. **Maintain Traceability**: Keep links between proposals and implemented features
3. **Update Cross-References**: Ensure all documentation stays consistent
4. **Preserve History**: Archive proposals for future reference

## Common Proposal Types

### Feature Proposals
- New user-facing functionality
- Enhancements to existing features
- User experience improvements

### Module Proposals
- New system components
- Service integrations
- Infrastructure changes

### Process Proposals
- Development workflow changes
- Documentation improvements
- Quality assurance enhancements

### Architecture Proposals
- System design changes
- Technology stack updates
- Performance optimizations

## Getting Started

1. **Identify the Need**: Clearly understand what problem you're trying to solve
2. **Use the Template**: Start with the [PROPOSAL Template](../../templates/PROPOSAL.template.md)
3. **Gather Input**: Discuss with relevant stakeholders early
4. **Iterate**: Refine the proposal based on feedback
5. **Follow Process**: Move through the lifecycle stages appropriately
