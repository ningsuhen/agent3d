# Deployment

This document outlines the deployment process for the Agent3D framework.

## Overview

Agent3D is primarily a documentation framework and doesn't require traditional deployment. Instead, it's integrated into LLM agents through the Agent Guideline Protocol.

## Integration Methods

### Method 1: Direct URL Reference

The simplest integration method is to have the LLM agent directly reference the Agent3D guidelines URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ningsuhen/agent3d/main/AGENT-GUIDELINES.md
```

This approach requires the agent to have internet access but ensures it always has the latest guidelines.

### Method 2: Local Cache with Periodic Updates

For better performance and offline capability, implement the full Agent Guideline Protocol:

1. Initial retrieval of guidelines
2. Local caching as `.agent-guidelines.md`
3. Periodic checking for updates (e.g., every 6 hours)
4. Updating local cache when remote guidelines change

## CI/CD Integration

To enforce documentation-code alignment in CI/CD pipelines:

1. Add a pre-commit hook that verifies documentation updates for code changes
2. Implement a CI check that validates documentation completeness
3. Add a documentation drift detector that fails the build if code and docs are misaligned

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Documentation Validation

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  validate-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Check for documentation updates
        run: |
          # Script to check if code changes have corresponding doc changes
          # or are tagged with docs-n/a
          
      - name: Validate documentation completeness
        run: |
          # Script to ensure all required documentation exists
          
      - name: Check for documentation-code alignment
        run: |
          # Script to verify documentation accurately reflects code
```

## Environment Setup

No special environment setup is required for Agent3D itself, but for language-specific development:

### Python Projects

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Unix/MacOS
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### JavaScript Projects

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### Java Projects

```bash
# Build with Maven
./mvnw clean install

# or with Gradle
./gradlew build
```

### Go Projects

```bash
# Initialize module
go mod init github.com/username/project

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build
go build
```

## Monitoring and Logging

For agents implementing the Agent Guideline Protocol:

1. Log guideline retrieval attempts and successes/failures
2. Track guideline version changes
3. Monitor documentation-code alignment metrics
4. Log DDD pass executions and outcomes

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise with new guideline versions:

1. Revert to a previous version of the guidelines
2. Update the local cache with the stable version
3. Implement a version pinning mechanism if needed
