# Execution Plan: Development Pass Creation

**Created**: 2024-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Type**: Framework Enhancement
**Scope**: Combine Planning Pass and Implementation Pass into unified Development Pass
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours

## Change Overview
Combine the existing Planning Pass (#3) and Implementation Pass (#4) into a single Development Pass that:
- Scans all relevant docs from docs/ to identify features/drift
- Offers AUTO MODE (picks features based on priority) or PICKER MODE (human chooses)
- Documents all execution steps to docs/runs/EXEC-PLAN-{change-name}.md
- Executes steps in loop until completion
- Preserves all existing functionality from both passes
