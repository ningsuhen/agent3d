# Execution Plan: Comprehensive Horizontal Merging Pass

**Created:** 2025-01-27
**Author:** Agent3D DDD Framework
**Status:** Ready to Execute
**Type:** Repository-Wide Refactoring
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 hours

## Change Overview

Comprehensive horizontal merging across the entire Agent3D repository to eliminate redundancy, merge overlapping files, and optimize for LLM consumption while preserving all essential functionality and maintaining documentation quality.

## Execution Environment

**Branch**: exec-plan/comprehensive-horizontal-merging (auto-commit enabled)
**Working Directory**: Project root
**Configuration**: .agent3d-config.yml (memorized with exec_plan_branches enabled)
**Templates**: ~/.agent3d/templates/
**Workflow**: Auto-commit steps/checkpoints, confirm merge to main

## Horizontal Merging Strategy

### Primary Merge Targets
1. **Language Rules**: Merge `{lang}.md` with `{lang}-review-guidelines.md` files
2. **Template System**: Consolidate validation rules, merge similar templates
3. **Pass Files**: Merge redundant configuration examples and process descriptions
4. **Documentation**: Merge overlapping content files (ADVANCED-FEATURES + CONFIGURATION-GUIDE)
5. **Configuration**: Streamline and consolidate configuration examples

### Merging Principles
- **File Consolidation**: Merge files with overlapping purposes into single comprehensive files
- **Preserve Functionality**: All essential information maintained during merges
- **Eliminate Redundancy**: Remove duplicate information across merged files
- **Logical Grouping**: Combine related content that belongs together
