### Feature 3: Language-Specific Rules
**Requirement ID:** REQ-003
**User Story:** US-005, US-006

#### Scenario 1: Language Rule Coverage
**Given:** A developer is working in a specific programming language
**When:** They access language-specific rules
**Then:** Comprehensive guidelines are available for that language

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Python rules cover environment, style, testing, performance
- [ ] JavaScript rules cover modern patterns, async, frameworks

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path Scenarios
1. **Scenario:** New project setup with Requirements Pass
   - **Steps:** Execute Requirements Pass on empty project
   - **Expected Result:** Complete requirements documentation created
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** All 4 requirements documents exist and are complete

2. **Scenario:** Full Pass execution
   - **Steps:** Execute Full Pass on existing project
   - **Expected Result:** All passes complete successfully with improved alignment
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** DDD-STATUS.md shows 95%+ alignment across all passes

### Edge Case Scenarios
1. **Scenario:** Partial documentation exists
   - **Steps:** Execute pass when some documentation already exists
   - **Expected Result:** Existing documentation is updated, not replaced
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** No data loss, incremental improvements made

2. **Scenario:** Network unavailable during guideline sync
   - **Steps:** Attempt guideline synchronization without network
   - **Expected Result:** Local cache is used, sync scheduled for later
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Graceful degradation, no functionality loss
