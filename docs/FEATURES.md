# Features

This document outlines the features of the Agent3D documentation framework, grouped by module.

## Important Note

**Agent3D is a documentation-only framework.** It does not contain any implementations, libraries, or code to import. The features listed below refer to the documentation guidelines and principles defined in this repository, not to functional components.

## Core Documentation Framework

- [x] Agent Guideline Protocol - Guidelines for agents to retrieve and follow DDD principles (Criteria: Agents can fetch, cache, and follow remote guidelines automatically)
- [x] DDD Pass System - Structured approach to documentation-driven development (Criteria: All 9 numbered passes plus Full Pass are documented and executable)
- [x] Documentation Standards - Guidelines for documentation completeness and accuracy (Criteria: All required documentation files have templates and validation criteria)

## Documentation Passes

- [x] Foundation Pass - Creating foundational documentation and architecture (Criteria: All 6 required documentation files are created and complete)
- [x] Documentation Pass - Documenting features, requirements, and priorities (Criteria: All features have acceptance criteria and test cases are documented)
- [x] Synchronization Pass - Aligning documentation with code at any scale (Criteria: Documentation matches implementation with zero drift indicators)
- [x] Quality Pass - Verifying and improving documentation quality (Criteria: All documentation meets clarity and consistency standards)
- [x] Prune Pass - Removing outdated or redundant content (Criteria: No duplicate or obsolete content remains in documentation)

## Implementation Passes

- [x] Implementation Pass - Implementing features with basic test coverage (Criteria: All documented features have corresponding implementations with basic tests)
- [x] Testing Pass - Adding comprehensive tests and verifying edge cases (Criteria: 90%+ test coverage with automated execution framework)
- [x] Refactoring Pass - Cleaning up code without changing functionality (Criteria: Code quality improvements without breaking existing features)
- [x] Code Review Pass - Reviewing PR changes and providing feedback (Criteria: All PRs receive structured review with actionable feedback)

## Language-Specific Rules

- [x] Python Rules - Development guidelines for Python projects (Criteria: Complete rules covering environment, style, and testing for Python)
- [x] JavaScript Rules - Development guidelines for JavaScript projects (Criteria: Complete rules covering environment, style, and testing for JavaScript)
- [x] Java Rules - Development guidelines for Java projects (Criteria: Complete rules covering environment, style, and testing for Java)
- [x] Go Rules - Development guidelines for Go projects (Criteria: Complete rules covering environment, style, and testing for Go)

## Integration Guidelines

- [x] LLM Agent Integration - Guidelines for instructing LLM coding agents to follow Agent3D principles (Criteria: Agents can automatically fetch, cache, and follow DDD guidelines)
- [x] CI/CD Integration - Documentation for validating documentation-code alignment in CI/CD pipelines (Criteria: Automated validation prevents documentation-code drift)
- [x] Version Control Integration - Best practices for documentation in version control systems (Criteria: Documentation changes are tracked and validated in version control)

## Status Tracking

- [x] DDD Status Tracking - System for monitoring pass execution and drift indicators (Criteria: Real-time tracking of all pass statuses with drift indicators)
- [x] Progress Indicators - Visual progress bars and completion tracking (Criteria: Visual progress representation for all passes with percentage completion)
- [x] Drift Detection - Phase-specific drift monitoring and alerts (Criteria: Automated detection of documentation-code misalignment with severity levels)
