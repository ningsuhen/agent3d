# Features

This document outlines the features of the Agent3D documentation framework, grouped by module.

## Important Note

**Agent3D is a documentation-only framework.** It does not contain any implementations, libraries, or code to import. The features listed below refer to the documentation guidelines and principles defined in this repository, not to functional components.

## Core Documentation Framework

- [x] Agent Guideline Protocol - Guidelines for agents to retrieve and follow DDD principles (Criteria: Agents can fetch, cache, and follow remote guidelines automatically)
- [x] DDD Pass System - Structured approach to documentation-driven development (Criteria: All 9 numbered passes plus Full Pass are documented and executable)
- [x] Documentation Standards - Guidelines for documentation completeness and accuracy (Criteria: All required documentation files have templates and validation criteria)

## Documentation Passes

- [x] Foundation Pass - Creating foundational documentation and architecture (Criteria: All 6 required documentation files are created and complete)
- [x] Documentation Pass - Documenting features, requirements, and priorities (Criteria: All features have acceptance criteria and test cases are documented)
- [x] Synchronization Pass - Aligning documentation with code at any scale (Criteria: Documentation matches implementation with zero drift indicators)
- [x] Quality Pass - Verifying and improving documentation quality (Criteria: All documentation meets clarity and consistency standards)
- [x] Prune Pass - Removing outdated or redundant content (Criteria: No duplicate or obsolete content remains in documentation)

## Implementation Passes

- [x] Implementation Pass - Implementing features with basic test coverage
- [x] Testing Pass - Adding comprehensive tests and verifying edge cases
- [x] Refactoring Pass - Cleaning up code without changing functionality
- [x] Code Review Pass - Reviewing PR changes and providing feedback

## Language-Specific Rules

- [x] Python Rules - Development guidelines for Python projects
- [x] JavaScript Rules - Development guidelines for JavaScript projects
- [x] Java Rules - Development guidelines for Java projects
- [x] Go Rules - Development guidelines for Go projects

## Integration Guidelines

- [x] LLM Agent Integration - Guidelines for instructing LLM coding agents to follow Agent3D principles
- [x] CI/CD Integration - Documentation for validating documentation-code alignment in CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Version Control Integration - Best practices for documentation in version control systems

## Status Tracking

- [x] DDD Status Tracking - System for monitoring pass execution and drift indicators
- [x] Progress Indicators - Visual progress bars and completion tracking
- [x] Drift Detection - Phase-specific drift monitoring and alerts
