# Features

This document outlines the features of the Agent3D documentation framework, grouped by module.

## Important Note

**Agent3D is a documentation-only framework.** It does not contain any implementations, libraries, or code to import. The features listed below refer to the documentation guidelines and principles defined in this repository, not to functional components.

## Core Documentation Framework

- [x] Agent Guideline Protocol - Guidelines for agents to retrieve and follow DDD principles (Criteria: Agents can fetch, cache, and follow remote guidelines automatically)
- [x] DDD Pass System - Structured approach to documentation-driven development (Criteria: All 9 numbered passes plus Full Pass are documented and executable)
- [x] Documentation Standards - Guidelines for documentation completeness and accuracy (Criteria: All required documentation files have templates and validation criteria)

## Documentation Passes

- [x] Foundation Pass - Creating foundational documentation and architecture (Criteria: All 6 required documentation files are created and complete)
  - [x] README Creation - Project overview and setup instructions (Criteria: Clear project description with usage guidelines)
  - [x] Architecture Documentation - System design and component relationships (Criteria: Complete architectural diagrams and decisions)
  - [x] Feature Specification - Comprehensive feature listing with acceptance criteria (Criteria: All features documented with measurable criteria)
- [x] Documentation Pass - Documenting features, requirements, and priorities (Criteria: All features have acceptance criteria and test cases are documented)
  - [x] Feature Documentation - Complete feature specifications (Criteria: All features have acceptance criteria)
  - [x] Test Case Documentation - Comprehensive test specifications (Criteria: All features have corresponding test cases)
  - [x] Task Documentation - Prioritized work backlog (Criteria: All tasks are prioritized and actionable)
- [x] Synchronization Pass - Aligning documentation with code at any scale (Criteria: Documentation matches implementation with zero drift indicators)
- [x] Quality Pass - Verifying and improving documentation quality (Criteria: All documentation meets clarity and consistency standards)
- [x] Prune Pass - Removing outdated or redundant content (Criteria: No duplicate or obsolete content remains in documentation)

## Implementation Passes

- [x] Implementation Pass - Implementing features with basic test coverage (Criteria: All documented features have corresponding implementations with basic tests)
  - [x] Core Implementation - Basic feature implementation (Criteria: All documented features are implemented)
  - [x] Basic Testing - Initial test coverage (Criteria: Core functionality has test coverage)
- [x] Testing Pass - Adding comprehensive tests and verifying edge cases (Criteria: 90%+ test coverage with automated execution framework)
  - [x] Test Framework Setup - Automated testing infrastructure (Criteria: Test execution framework is documented and functional)
  - [x] Comprehensive Coverage - Full test suite implementation (Criteria: All test cases from TEST-CASES.md are implemented)
  - [x] Edge Case Testing - Boundary and error condition testing (Criteria: All edge cases are covered with tests)
- [x] Refactoring Pass - Cleaning up code without changing functionality (Criteria: Code quality improvements without breaking existing features)
  - [x] Code Quality Improvements - Style and structure enhancements (Criteria: Code meets quality standards without functional changes)
  - [x] Performance Optimization - Efficiency improvements (Criteria: Performance improvements without breaking functionality)
- [x] Code Review Pass - Reviewing PR changes and providing feedback (Criteria: All PRs receive structured review with actionable feedback)
  - [x] Review Process - Structured code review workflow (Criteria: All PRs follow documented review process)
  - [x] Feedback Templates - Standardized review feedback formats (Criteria: Reviews use consistent templates and checklists)
  - [x] Automation Integration - CI/CD review automation (Criteria: Automated checks supplement manual reviews)

## Language-Specific Rules

- [x] Python Rules - Development guidelines for Python projects (Criteria: Complete rules covering environment, style, and testing for Python)
- [x] JavaScript Rules - Development guidelines for JavaScript projects (Criteria: Complete rules covering environment, style, and testing for JavaScript)
- [x] Java Rules - Development guidelines for Java projects (Criteria: Complete rules covering environment, style, and testing for Java)
- [x] Go Rules - Development guidelines for Go projects (Criteria: Complete rules covering environment, style, and testing for Go)

## Integration Guidelines

- [x] LLM Agent Integration - Guidelines for instructing LLM coding agents to follow Agent3D principles (Criteria: Agents can automatically fetch, cache, and follow DDD guidelines)
- [x] CI/CD Integration - Documentation for validating documentation-code alignment in CI/CD pipelines (Criteria: Automated validation prevents documentation-code drift)
- [x] Version Control Integration - Best practices for documentation in version control systems (Criteria: Documentation changes are tracked and validated in version control)

## Status Tracking

- [x] DDD Status Tracking - System for monitoring pass execution and drift indicators (Criteria: Real-time tracking of all pass statuses with drift indicators)
  - [x] Pass Status Monitoring - Individual pass progress tracking (Criteria: Each pass has status, progress, and drift indicators)
  - [x] Alignment Metrics - Quantitative alignment measurement (Criteria: Numerical alignment percentages for all passes)
  - [x] Drift Indicators - Documentation-code misalignment detection (Criteria: Color-coded drift levels with severity indicators)
- [x] Progress Indicators - Visual progress bars and completion tracking (Criteria: Visual progress representation for all passes with percentage completion)
  - [x] Visual Progress Bars - Graphical completion representation (Criteria: Progress bars show completion percentage visually)
  - [x] Completion Statistics - Numerical progress tracking (Criteria: Exact completion counts and percentages)
- [x] Drift Detection - Phase-specific drift monitoring and alerts (Criteria: Automated detection of documentation-code misalignment with severity levels)
  - [x] Severity Classification - Drift level categorization (Criteria: Clear classification of drift severity levels)
  - [x] Alert System - Drift notification mechanism (Criteria: Alerts trigger when drift exceeds thresholds)
