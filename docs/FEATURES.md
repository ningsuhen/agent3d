# Features Index

This document provides an index of all Agent3D features organized by module with FT-* identifiers for traceability.

## Important Note

**Agent3D is a documentation-only framework.** It does not contain any implementations, libraries, or code to import. The features listed below refer to the documentation guidelines and principles defined in this repository, not to functional components.

## New Merged FT-TC Structure

**As of 2025-01-27**, Agent3D has migrated to a **merged FT-TC structure** where features and their associated test cases are documented together in modular section files located in `docs/features/`. This replaces the previous separate `FEATURES.md` and `TEST-CASES.md` files.

### Structure Benefits:
- **Modular Organization:** Features organized by logical sections (core, passes, implementation, etc.)
- **Integrated Testing:** Test cases directly associated with their features
- **Better Traceability:** Clear FT-TC relationships in a single location
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new feature sections without modifying multiple files

### Migration Guide:
- **Old:** Single `docs/FEATURES.md` file with separate `docs/TEST-CASES.md`
- **New:** Multiple section files in `docs/features/` directory with merged FT-TC content
- **Compatibility:** Drift scanner supports both structures with automatic fallback

## Quick Reference

- **Total Features:** 38 features across 8 modules
- **Status:** All modules in production
- **Documentation:** Each module has detailed feature specifications with test cases
- **Navigation:** Click any module link above to view detailed features and test cases

## Working with the New Structure

### For Developers:
```bash
# View all features by section
ls docs/features/

# View specific feature section
cat docs/features/core.md

# Run drift analysis on new structure
python3 tools/drift_scanner.py --mode ft-mapping
```

### For Documentation:
- **Add new features:** Edit appropriate section file in `docs/features/`
- **Create new sections:** Add new `.md` file in `docs/features/` directory
- **Test case integration:** Include test cases directly under each feature
- **Validation:** Use drift scanner to verify FT-TC relationships

### Template Usage:
- **Individual features:** Use `templates/FEATURES.template.md`
- **New modules:** Use `templates/FEATURE-module.template.md`
