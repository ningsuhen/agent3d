purpose: |
    The DDD Migration procedure provides a systematic way to discover, select, and execute
    DDD framework migrations. It scans the migrations folder for available migrations,
    presents them to the user for selection, and executes the chosen migration following
    the migration YAML specification.

triggers:
  - "User requests framework migration"
  - "Configuration updates needed"
  - "Template format changes"
  - "Framework version upgrades"
  - "Manual migration execution"

# LLM Instructions for DDD Migration:
# 1. Always scan migrations/ folder first
# 2. Present clear migration options to user
# 3. Get explicit confirmation before execution
# 4. Follow migration steps exactly as defined
# 5. Create backups before making changes
# 6. Validate each step before proceeding
# 7. Update .agent3d-tmp/migration-tracker.yml throughout process
# 8. Execute rollback immediately on failure
