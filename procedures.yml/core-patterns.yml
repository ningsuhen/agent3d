usage_notes:
- "Load configuration once per session"
- "Use memorized patterns for all decisions"
- "Cache language rules on first access"
- "Apply speed rules consistently across all passes"
- "ALWAYS use YAML format for DDD-STATUS and EXEC-PLAN files"
- "Use templates from ~/.agent3d/templates.yml/ for execution tracking"
