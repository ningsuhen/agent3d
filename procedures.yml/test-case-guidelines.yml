  name: "Test Case and Sub-Test Guidelines"
  version: "2.0.0"
  created: "2025-01-29"
  last_updated: "2025-01-29"
  purpose: "Unified guidelines for test case selection, sub-test usage, and implementation"
  replaces: [ "docs/TEST-CASE-SELECTION-GUIDELINES.md", "docs/TC-SUBTEST-GUIDELINES.md" ]

# Core Philosophy
philosophy:
  principle: "Quality over quantity - select test cases based on feature needs and risk"
  approach: "Judicious selection rather than meeting arbitrary numerical goals"
  focus: "Feature reliability and user experience over test count quotas"

# Test Case Structure and Mapping

  hierarchy:
    main_test_case:
      format: "TC-####"
      description: "Maps to individual test functions"
      example: "TC-AUTH-001"

      description: "Maps to parameters within parameterized tests"
      example: "TC-AUTH-001-a, TC-AUTH-001-b"

  implementation_guidelines:
    test_function_mapping:
    - "Each TC-#### maps to exactly one test function"
    - "Test function docstring must include the TC-#### identifier"
    - "Function name should be descriptive of the test case purpose"

    - "Each parameter set represents one sub-test with specific test data"
    - "Sub-test identifiers follow alphabetical sequence: a, b, c, d, etc."

  tc_identifier_placement:
    allowed_locations:
    - "Test function docstrings (for TC-#### main test cases)"
    - "Parameter values in @pytest.mark.parametrize (for TC-####-{a,b,c...} sub-tests)"
    - "Comments directly above parameterize decorators (for grouping context)"

    forbidden_locations:
    - "Comments outside test functions"
    - "Data structures or constants"
    - "Helper functions or utilities"
    - "Variable names or configuration"

implementation_examples:
  good_sub_test_usage:
    description: "Parameterized testing with same logic, different inputs"
    code_example: |

          assert validate_format(test_data, test_aspect) is True

  poor_sub_test_usage:
    description: "Different functionality grouped incorrectly"
    problem: "These should be separate test cases as they test different functionality"
    code_example: |
      # ❌ WRONG - Different logic should be separate test cases
      @pytest.mark.parametrize("operation,data", [
          # TC-USER-001-a
          ( "create_user", {"name": "John"}),
          # TC-USER-001-b
          ( "delete_user", {"id": 123}),
          # TC-USER-001c
          ( "send_email", {"to": "user@example.com"}),
      ])

    description: "Proper separation of different functionality"
    code_example: |
      def test_user_creation():

    - "Clear purpose - each test has specific objective"
    - "Maintainable - tests are easy to understand and update"
    - "Efficient - no redundant or overlapping tests"

  poor_test_coverage:
    characteristics:
    - "Arbitrary numbers - 'Must have 5 test cases per feature'"
    - "Trivial tests - testing obvious or framework functionality"
    - "Redundant tests - multiple tests covering same scenario"
    - "Complex sub-tests - sub-tests that should be separate cases"
