  performance_rules:
    - "Load language rules once per session"
    - "Cache patterns in working memory"
    - "Apply from memory without file access"
    - "Use memorized patterns for validation"

  validation:
    - "Check code against memorized language patterns"
    - "Ensure compliance with language-specific rules"
    - "Apply formatting standards consistently"
