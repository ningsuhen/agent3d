  description: "Agent3D has migrated to a merged FT-TC structure for improved documentation organization and traceability"
  
  benefits:
    - "Modular organization: Features grouped by logical sections"
    - "Integrated testing: Test cases directly under their features"
    - "Better traceability: Clear FT-TC relationships in single location"
    - "Scalability: Easy to add new sections without modifying multiple files"
    - "Drift scanner support: Automatic detection of merged structure with fallback"

working_procedures:
  adding_features:
    steps:
      - "Edit appropriate section file in docs/features/"
      - "Follow the feature format template"
      - "Include test cases directly under the feature"
      - "Run drift scanner to validate relationships"
    
    validation: "python3 ~/.agent3d/tools/drift_scanner.py --mode ft-mapping"
  
  creating_new_sections:
    steps:
      - "Create new .md file in docs/features/"
      - "Use templates/FEATURE-module.template.md"
      - "Follow FT-SECTION-NNN naming convention"
      - "Update docs/FEATURES.md index"
    
    naming_convention: "FT-SECTION-NNN"
    template: "templates/FEATURE-module.template.md"
  
  validation_commands:
    merged_structure: "python3 ~/.agent3d/tools/drift_scanner.py --mode ft-mapping"
    ft_tc_relationships: "python3 ~/.agent3d/tools/drift_scanner.py --mode ft-tc-mapping"
    comprehensive: "python3 ~/.agent3d/tools/drift_scanner.py --mode all"

naming_conventions:
  feature_ids:
    pattern: "FT-SECTION-NNN"
    examples:
      - "FT-CORE-001"
      - "FT-IMPL-002"
      - "FT-LANG-003"
  
  test_case_ids:
    pattern: "TC-SECTION-NNN"
    examples:
      - "TC-CORE-001"
      - "TC-IMPL-002"
      - "TC-LANG-003"
  
  sub_test_ids:
    pattern: "TC-SECTION-NNNx"
    examples:
      - "TC-CORE-001a"
      - "TC-IMPL-002b"
      - "TC-LANG-003c"

migration_benefits:
  modular_organization: "Features grouped by logical sections"
  integrated_testing: "Test cases directly under their features"
  better_traceability: "Clear FT-TC relationships in single location"
  scalability: "Easy to add new sections without modifying multiple files"
  drift_scanner_support: "Automatic detection of merged structure with fallback"

drift_scanner_compatibility:
  automatic_detection: "Drift scanner automatically detects merged structure"
  fallback_support: "Falls back to legacy structure if merged structure not found"
  validation_modes:
    - "ft-mapping: Validates feature-test relationships"
    - "ft-tc-mapping: Validates FT-TC cross-references"
    - "all: Comprehensive validation including merged structure"

best_practices:
  - "Use appropriate section files for feature organization"
  - "Maintain clear FT-TC relationships within each section"
  - "Follow consistent naming conventions"
  - "Validate structure with drift scanner after changes"
  - "Keep test cases directly under their parent features"
  - "Use sub-tests only for parameterized testing scenarios"
  - "Update docs/FEATURES.md index when adding new sections"
