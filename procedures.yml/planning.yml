best_practices:
- "Create detailed execution plans for complex changes"
- "Update status markers regularly during execution"
- "Use checkpoints to track major milestones"
- "Validate completion criteria before marking tasks done"
- "Maintain DDD status after each pass"
- "Archive completed plans for future reference"
- "ALWAYS use YAML format for execution plans and DDD status"
- "Use templates from ~/.agent3d/templates/ for consistency"
- "Never create Markdown versions of execution tracking files"
