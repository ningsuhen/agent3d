# Documentation-Driven Development (DDD) for LLM Coding Agents
*"Write the docs, then write the codeâ€”keep it lean, test it for real."*

## Configuration

All Agent3D resources are accessed from `~/.agent3d`. This file (`~/.agent3d/AGENT-GUIDELINES.md`) is the main entry point for all operations.

## Project Root Detection
**CRITICAL**: Before starting any DDD work, establish the project root. See [Common Procedures - Project Root Establishment](docs/COMMON-PROCEDURES.md#project-root-establishment) for complete instructions.

## Prime Directive
**Documentation leads, code follows.** Always update docs before implementing code. Documentation is the single source of truth.

## Core Workflow

| Phase | Action | Human Role |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Scan** | Detect missing/outdated docs | â€” |
| **Draft** | Create/update documentation | â€” |
| **Ask** | Clarify gaps and decisions | Provide input |
| **Sync** | Implement code matching docs | Review & approve |

**Project Setup**: Establish project root by finding or creating `.agent3d` file
**DDD Pass**: Execute Scan â†’ Draft â†’ Ask â†’ Sync, then commit with `DDD: <description>`

### DDD Passes

- [Full Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/full_pass.md) - Comprehensive pass encompassing all aspects
- [0. Requirements Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/0_requirements_pass.md) - Documenting comprehensive requirements and business objectives
- [1. Foundation Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/1_foundation_pass.md) - Creating foundational documentation and architecture
- [2. Documentation Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/2_documentation_pass.md) - Documenting features, requirements, and priorities
- [3. Implementation Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/3_implementation_pass.md) - Implementing features with basic test coverage
- [4. Testing Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/4_testing_pass.md) - Adding comprehensive tests and verifying edge cases
- [5. Refactoring Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/5_refactoring_pass.md) - Cleaning up code without changing functionality
- [6. Code Review Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/6_code_review_pass.md) - Reviewing PR changes and providing feedback
- [7. Synchronization Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/7_synchronization_pass.md) - Aligning documentation with code at any scale
- [8. Quality Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/8_quality_pass.md) - Verifying and improving documentation quality
- [9. Prune Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/9_prune_pass.md) - Removing outdated or redundant content
- [10. Reverse Pass](~/.agent3d/passes/simplified/10_reverse_pass.md) - Detecting and addressing reverse drift (implementation without documentation)

## Development Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Requirements-Driven** | Implement only documented requirements from `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` |
| **Lean Code** | Build only what is specified in requirements and acceptance criteria |
| **Real Tests** | Use integration tests; avoid mocks except for external APIs |
| **Full Traceability** | Link requirements (`REQ-####`) to features to test cases (`TC-####`) |
| **Requirements Validation** | Ensure all features trace back to business objectives |
| **Fast Feedback** | Run critical tests in CI |
| **Language Rules** | Fetch and memorize language-specific rules from links below, apply consistently |
| **LLM-Friendly Docs** | Use clear, concise language; consistent structure; no legacy references |

### Language-Specific Rules

- [Python](~/.agent3d/rules/python.md) - Rules for Python development
- [JavaScript](~/.agent3d/rules/javascript.md) - Rules for JavaScript development
- [Java](~/.agent3d/rules/java.md) - Rules for Java development
- [Go](~/.agent3d/rules/go.md) - Rules for Go development

## Required Documentation

| File | Purpose | Local Template Path |
|------|---------|----------|
| `README.md` | Project overview | `~/.agent3d/templates/README.template.md` |
| `docs/BUSINESS-OBJECTIVES.md` | Business goals, metrics, and success criteria | `~/.agent3d/templates/BUSINESS-OBJECTIVES.template.md` |
| `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` | Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements | `~/.agent3d/templates/REQUIREMENTS.template.md` |
| `docs/USER-STORIES.md` | User personas, stories, and use cases | `~/.agent3d/templates/USER-STORIES.template.md` |
| `docs/ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA.md` | Testable acceptance criteria for all requirements | `~/.agent3d/templates/ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA.template.md` |
| `docs/FEATURES.md` | Feature checklist with acceptance criteria | `~/.agent3d/templates/FEATURES.template.md` |
| `docs/HIGH-LEVEL-DESIGN.md` | System design with diagrams and decisions | `~/.agent3d/templates/HIGH-LEVEL-DESIGN.template.md` |
| `docs/TASKS.md` | Work backlog organized by priority | `~/.agent3d/templates/TASKS.template.md` |
| `docs/TEST-CASES.md` | Test specifications with TC-#### format | `~/.agent3d/templates/TEST-CASES.template.md` |
| `docs/DDD-STATUS.md` | DDD Pass Status, Drift and Health tracking | `~/.agent3d/templates/DDD-STATUS.template.md` |
| `docs/designs/*.md` | Component design specifications | `~/.agent3d/templates/DETAILED-DESIGN.template.md` |
| `docs/proposals/*.md` | Design proposals for unimplemented features | `~/.agent3d/templates/PROPOSAL.template.md` |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Chronological record of all project changes | `~/.agent3d/templates/CHANGELOG.template.md` |

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: All documentation creation and standards are defined in [Common Procedures](docs/COMMON-PROCEDURES.md). Follow these procedures for all DDD activities.

---

## Operational Standards

**Documentation-Code Alignment:**
- Each commit must update documentation OR include `docs-n/a` tag
- CI/CD pipelines must validate documentation-code alignment
- Agents must reject tasks that violate DDD principles

**All procedures defined in [Common Procedures](docs/COMMON-PROCEDURES.md):**
- Repository management, template usage, documentation standards
- Feature completion criteria, progress tracking, status updates

## Agent Instructions

**Workflow:**
1. Establish project root (`.agent3d` file)
2. Follow `~/.agent3d/AGENT-GUIDELINES.md` (this file)
3. Run DDD pass for missing/outdated documentation
4. Favor integration tests over mocks
