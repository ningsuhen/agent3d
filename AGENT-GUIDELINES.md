# Documentation-Driven Development (DDD) for LLM Coding Agents
*"Write the docs, then write the code‚Äîkeep it lean, test it for real."*

## Prime Directive
**Documentation leads, code follows.** Always update docs before implementing code. Documentation is the single source of truth.

## Core Workflow

| Phase | Action | Human Role |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Scan** | Detect missing/outdated docs | ‚Äî |
| **Draft** | Create/update documentation | ‚Äî |
| **Ask** | Clarify gaps and decisions | Provide input |
| **Sync** | Implement code matching docs | Review & approve |

**DDD Pass**: Execute Scan ‚Üí Draft ‚Üí Ask ‚Üí Sync, then commit with `DDD: <description>`

### DDD Passes

## Development Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Lean Code** | Implement only documented requirements |
| **Real Tests** | Use integration tests; avoid mocks except for external APIs |
| **Traceability** | Reference test cases as `TC-####` from `docs/TEST-CASES.md` |
| **Fast Feedback** | Run critical tests in CI |
| **Language Rules** | Fetch and memorize language-specific rules from links below, apply consistently |

### Language-Specific Rules

- [Python](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ningsuhen/agent3d/main/rules/python.md) - Rules for Python development
- [JavaScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ningsuhen/agent3d/main/rules/javascript.md) - Rules for JavaScript development
- [Java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ningsuhen/agent3d/main/rules/java.md) - Rules for Java development
- [Go](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ningsuhen/agent3d/main/rules/go.md) - Rules for Go development

## Required Documentation

| File | Purpose | Content When Missing |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `README.md` | Project overview | Goal, tech stack, setup, examples |
| `docs/FEATURES.md` | Feature checklist | `- [ ] Feature-Name ‚Äî description` |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System design | Diagrams, data flow, decisions |
| `docs/TASKS.md` | Work backlog | `- [ ] Task ‚Äî priority/source` |
| `docs/TEST-CASES.md` | Test specifications | `TC-####`, steps, expected results |
| `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | Operations guide | Environments, CI/CD, monitoring |

**Missing Documentation**: Always create complete content before coding.

---

## Documentation Enforcement
- Each commit must update documentation OR include `docs-n/a` tag
- CI/CD pipelines must validate documentation-code alignment
- Agents must reject tasks that violate DDD principles

## Task Formatting Guidelines

**For Features, Tasks, and Test Cases:**
- Use markdown task lists: `- [ ]` for pending, `- [x]` for completed
- Keep entries single-line for clarity
- Group related items logically
- **Follow TEST-CASES.md structure**: Start with a Summary section containing statistics and overview, then organize content into logical sections with bullet points

**For Process Execution:**
- Use ‚úÖ symbol to mark completed steps during DDD pass execution
- Add ‚úÖ next to steps as you complete them for real-time progress tracking

**Examples:**
- `- [ ] Implement user authentication` (pending task)
- `- [x] Add login validation` (completed task)
- `‚úÖ Review feature documentation` (step completed during execution)

**Document Structure Example (following TEST-CASES.md pattern):**
```
## üìä Summary
- **Total Items:** X
- **Completed:** Y ‚úÖ
- **Pending:** Z ‚è∏Ô∏è

## üìö Section Name
- [ ] **Item-ID** - Description (Type, Priority)
```

## Agent Instructions
Follow `.agent-guidelines.md`. When documentation is missing or outdated, run a DDD pass (update docs, ask questions, then sync code/tests/deploy). Keep code lean and favor integration/end-to-end tests over mocks unless external APIs require them. Format all tasks as single-line markdown tasks and mark execution progress with ‚úÖ.

**Language-Specific Rules**: At the start of each project, identify the programming language(s) and fetch the corresponding language-specific rules using the links provided in the Language-Specific Rules section below. These rules are stored remotely and must be retrieved via web-fetch. Memorize these rules and apply them consistently throughout all development activities including implementation, refactoring, and code review.
