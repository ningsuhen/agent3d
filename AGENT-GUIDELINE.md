# Documentation-Driven Development (DDD) for LLM Coding Agents
*“Write the docs, then write the code—keep it lean, test it for real.”*

---

## 0  Prime Directive  
**Update Docs → Iterate with User → Implement → Validate.**  
Docs are the single source of truth; code, tests, and deployment scripts must never outpace them.

---

## 1  Agent Workflow

| Phase | Agent Action | Human Role |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **Scan** | Detect drift or missing docs by parsing repo. | — |
| **Draft** | Generate/refresh docs (§3) with full content. | — |
| **Ask** | Surface gaps, design options, or clarifications. | Supply answers / edits. |
| **Sync** | Finalize docs, then produce matching code, tests, CI, deploy scripts. | Review & approve. |
| **Guard** | Refuse or fail if docs & code diverge. | — |

> **DDD Pass** – When instructed, perform **Scan → Draft → Ask → Sync**, then commit  
> `DDD: <summary>` (or tag `docs-n/a` if no drift).

## 2  Lean-Code & Testing Principles

| Principle | Agent Rule |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Keep Code Lean** | Implement only what the current docs require; avoid speculative abstractions. |
| **Real Tests Over Mocks** | Prefer integration & end-to-end tests that exercise concrete components. Use mocks/stubs only when external calls (e.g., payment gateways) make them unavoidable. |
| **Traceability** | Each test references its `TC-####` in `docs/TEST-CASES.md`. |
| **Fast Feedback** | Critical end-to-end paths run in CI; heavier suites may run nightly. |

## 3  Primary Docs & Generation Rules

| File | Purpose | Full content if **missing** |
|------|---------|-----------------------------|
| `README.md` | Vision & quick-start | Goal, tech stack, install steps, example commands, demo, contributors, license |
| `docs/FEATURES.md` | Checklist | `[ ] Feature-Slug — scope`, grouped by module |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Design & decisions | Mermaid diagrams, data-flow, trade-offs |
| `docs/TASKS.md` | Backlog | `[ ] Task — link/source`, priority from TODOs/issues |
| `docs/TEST-CASES.md` | Canonical tests | `TC-####`, feature, preconditions, steps, expected result, **Automated?** |
| `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | Ops runbook | Envs, build scripts, IaC, containers, secrets, health checks, CI/CD, rollback |

**Missing-Doc Protocol** – Generate a full, content-rich version (no placeholders) before coding.

---

## 4  Drift Enforcement
* Each commit updates a doc file **or** tags `docs-n/a`.  
* CI fails on doc↔code mismatch or missing artifacts.  
* Agent rejects tasks that violate DDD or Lean-Code/Test rules.

---

### Minimal Guideline Prompt (embed in each agent)

> *Follow `.agent-guideline.md`.  
> If docs drift or a primary doc is missing, run a DDD pass (update docs, ask questions, then sync code/tests/deploy).  
> Keep code lean; favor integration/end-to-end tests, avoid mocks unless absolutely necessary.*
