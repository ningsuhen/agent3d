# DDD Status

**FORMAT SPECIFICATION:** This document must track the status and alignment of each DDD pass with drift indicators. Each pass entry must include:
- Status: Completed ✅, In Progress ⏸️, Pending ⏸️, Not Applicable 🚫, Ready ⏸️
- Alignment: Percentage with progress bar (e.g., 85% ████████░░)
- Drift: None 🟢, Low 🟡, Medium 🟠, High 🔴 with explanation
- Last Execution: Date when pass was last run
- Priority: High, Medium, Low based on current needs
- Notes: Brief explanation of current state
- Artifacts: List of deliverables with status indicators

**REQUIRED SECTIONS:**
1. Summary - Overall statistics
2. Pass Status Sections - Explanation of the repeating structure
3. Individual pass entries (Full Pass + 10 numbered passes)
4. Drift Indicators section
5. Metrics section

**PASS STRUCTURE:** Each DDD pass gets its own section following the same format. The document includes:
- Full Pass (comprehensive pass)
- 10 numbered passes (Foundation through Reverse)
- Each pass section repeats the same status tracking format

**METRICS CALCULATION:**

### Drift Calculation
**Drift** measures how much the current state deviates from the ideal state for a specific pass:
- **None (🟢):** 0-10% deviation - Current state matches pass objectives
- **Low (🟡):** 11-30% deviation - Minor gaps or inconsistencies
- **Medium (🟠):** 31-60% deviation - Significant gaps requiring attention
- **High (🔴):** 61-100% deviation - Major misalignment, pass needs re-execution

### Alignment Calculation
**Alignment** measures completion within the pass's specific scope:
- **100%:** All pass objectives fully achieved
- **80-99%:** Most objectives complete, minor items pending
- **60-79%:** Core objectives complete, some secondary items pending
- **40-59%:** Basic objectives complete, significant work remaining
- **0-39%:** Major objectives incomplete, pass needs substantial work

## 📋 Pass Status Sections

**NOTE:** The following sections repeat for each DDD pass (Full Pass + 10 numbered passes). Each pass has its own dedicated section with status tracking, progress indicators, drift measurements, and execution artifacts.

**Pass Structure:**
- **🔄 Full Pass** - Comprehensive pass encompassing all aspects
- **1️⃣ Foundation Pass** - Creating foundational documentation and architecture
- **2️⃣ Documentation Pass** - Documenting features, requirements, and priorities
- **3️⃣ Implementation Pass** - Implementing features with basic test coverage
- **4️⃣ Testing Pass** - Adding comprehensive tests and verifying edge cases
- **5️⃣ Refactoring Pass** - Cleaning up code without changing functionality
- **6️⃣ Code Review Pass** - Reviewing PR changes and providing feedback
- **7️⃣ Synchronization Pass** - Aligning documentation with code at any scale
- **8️⃣ Quality Pass** - Verifying and improving documentation quality
- **9️⃣ Prune Pass** - Removing outdated or redundant content
- **🔟 Reverse Pass** - Detecting and addressing reverse drift (implementation without documentation)
