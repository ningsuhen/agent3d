# Template Usage Instructions
template_usage:
  instructions:
    - "Replace all {{placeholder}} values with actual data"
    - "Update status and alignment percentages based on current state"
    - "Ensure drift levels match actual project conditions"
    - "Add or remove artifacts as needed for each pass"
    - "Update last_execution dates when passes are run"
    - "Remove this template_usage section when complete"
  
  validation_checklist:
    - "All passes have status, alignment, drift, execution date, and priority"
    - "Alignment percentages are realistic and justified"
    - "Drift levels are explained with specific reasons"
    - "Artifacts list is complete and up-to-date"
    - "Summary statistics match individual pass data"
    - "Health indicators reflect current project state"
