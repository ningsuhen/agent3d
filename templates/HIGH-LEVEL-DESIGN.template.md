# High-Level Design

**FORMAT SPECIFICATION:** This document must provide a comprehensive technical overview of the system high-level architecture. It must include:
- System overview with high-level description
- Core components and their responsibilities
- Data flow diagrams (using Mermaid syntax)
- Component interaction patterns
- Directory/file structure
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Integration points and dependencies
- Links to module detailed designs

**REQUIRED SECTIONS:**
1. System Overview - High-level description
2. Core Components - Main system parts and responsibilities
3. Data Flow - How information moves through the system
4. Component Interactions - How parts work together
5. Directory Structure - File organization
6. Technical Decisions - Key architectural choices
7. Dependencies - External systems and libraries
8. Module Detailed Designs - Links to detailed component specifications

**TEMPLATE:** (Do NOT include `<template>` tags in actual documentation)
