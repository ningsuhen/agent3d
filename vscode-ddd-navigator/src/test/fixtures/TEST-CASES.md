# Test Cases

## Authentication Tests

### User Login
- [x] **TC-0001** - User login with valid credentials (Automated, High)
- [x] **TC-0002** - User login with invalid credentials (Automated, High)
- [ ] **TC-0003a** - User login with expired session (Manual, Medium)

### Environment Tests
- [x] **TC-ENV-001** - Environment variable configuration (Automated, High)
- [ ] **TC-ENV-002** - Environment Map Configuration - Verify map-based environment configuration with enum keys in service options (Environment, High Priority) ⏸️
- [x] **TC-ENV-007** - Environment validation testing (Manual, Medium)

### Batch Processing
- [ ] **TC-BATCH-001** - Parallel execution strategy - Verify client-side parallel execution of multiple requests using asyncio.gather with proper error handling (Batching, High Priority) ⏸️
- [x] **TC-BATCH-002** - Sequential processing validation (Automated, Medium)

### Synchronization
- [x] **TC-SYNC-001** - Data synchronization between services (Automated, High)
- [ ] **TC-SYNC-002** - Conflict resolution in sync operations (Manual, High)

## Cross-References

This test case TC-0001 validates REQ-001 and relates to the User Authentication feature.
TC-ENV-002 should pass when environment configuration is properly implemented.
Cross-reference with TC-0002 and TC-0003a for comprehensive coverage.
